Herein, we report a facile one-pot \nsynthesis of covalent organic framework nanospheres (DT-COF NS) with a uniform \ndiameter of ∼600 nm under mild conditions. The as-prepared DT-COF NS exhibit \npronounced photoactivity under visible light irradiation and generate multiple \nreactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydroxyl radicals (•OH), superoxide \nanions (O2•-), singlet oxygen (1O2), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), via a type I \nphotodynamic pathway. Benefiting from this efficient ROS production, the COF \nnanospheres achieved over 99% bactericidal efficiency against both MRSA and \nEscherichia coli in vitro and in vivo level. Compared with conventional DT-COF \nNS synthesis routes requiring harsh conditions or complex templates, our \nstrategy offers a simple, mild, and scalable approach. These findings \ndemonstrate the great potential of DT-COF NS as next-generation photoactive \nantibacterial materials, paving the way for their future applications in \nadvanced antimicrobial systems.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acsabm.5c02103\nPMID: 41364775'},

The combination of CEE and Silymarin® exhibited potent \nantibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, \nPseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli with MIC values ranging from 182.32 \nto 201.63\xa0μg/mL. The combination of CEE and Silymarin® significantly reduced \nnitric oxide levels and increased superoxide dismutase activity in \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inflamed HepG-2 cells more than CEE and Silymarin® \nalone, thereby this combination acting as a potent anti-inflammatory and \nantioxidant candidate.

Investigation of \ncharacteristics beyond antibiotic resistance genes and classical virulence \nfactors is crucial to gain understanding of common traits among these pathogens. \nAnalysis of 22,267 publicly available E. coli genomes from five pathogenic and \none commensal sequence type (ST) revealed the L-sorbose phosphotransferase \nsystem (PTS ) as a pathogen-enriched marker. Although previously investigated \nfor evolutionary insights, this system has not been functionally assessed within \nhigh-risk clonal lineages, as performed in the present study. Our multi-omics \nresults demonstrate that the L-sorbose PTS is induced in pathogenic strains of \nST131 and ST648 in the presence of L-sorbose, conferring a competitive advantage \ncompared to a commensal ST10 strain.

This study investigates \nthe roles of Escherichia coli (E. coli)-encoded Lon protease in the metabolism \nof 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), a toxic industrial compound. Enhanced conversion \nof yellow-colored 2,4-DNP to a reddish-brown product was observed in a strain \nlacking Lon protease (Δlon). This observation led us to characterize and \nunderstand the mechanisms of 2,4-DNP metabolism. UV-visible and LC-MS analyses \nrevealed differences in the conversion products between the wild-type and Δlon. \nOne of the substrates of Lon protease is MarA, a transcription factor, and \nstudies with different mutants followed by trans complementation demonstrated \nMarA-dependent conversion. The bathochromic shift of spectral peaks suggested \nreduction processes and possible involvement of nitroreductase enzymes. Indeed, \nthe expression of two genes encoding nitroreductases, nfsA and nfsB, increased \nwith 2,4-DNP and was dependent on MarA. Importantly, the production of the \nreddish-brown product was lower in strains lacking nfsA or nfsB. Finally, LC-MS \nanalysis identified one of the conversion products of 2,4-DNP to be \n4-amino-2-nitrophenol (4,2-ANP). Dose studies with purified 4,2-ANP demonstrated \nthat it did not lower the growth of E. coli (unlike 2,4-DNP) and induced \nphenotypic antibiotic resistance in an acrB-dependent (like 2,4-DNP) but in a \nmarA-independent (unlike 2,4-DNP) manner. This study revealed how E. coli in the \nenvironment converts a toxic compound (2,4-DNP) into a lesser toxic compound \n(4,2-ANP) and helps survive in the presence of antibiotics. Overall, this study \ncontributes to our understanding of biological responses to nitroaromatics.\nIMPORTANCE: E. coli is one of the common microorganisms in feces-contaminated \nsewage and often interacts with several pollutants. This study identifies the \nroles of Lon protease and its substrate MarA in inducing nitroreductases, NfsA \nand NfsB, in reducing toxic 2,4-DNP to less toxic 4,2-ANP, a novel inducer of \nphenotypic antibiotic resistance in E. coli. This study sheds light on the roles \nof E. coli-encoded Lon protease upon exposure to harmful nitroaromatics. Common \nenvironmental pollutants can act as a selective pressure, favoring the survival \nas well as proliferation of bacteria containing antibiotic-resistant genes, \nwhich can easily be transferred to other bacteria through horizontal gene \ntransfer. This study offers insights into mitigation methods in E. coli, a \nwell-characterized model. It is possible that such environmental pollution \nstrategies may be translated to other models, such as Pseudomonas, which are \ncommonly used in bioremediation studies.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/aem.01603-25\nPMID: 41364024'},

Although T7 RNAP exhibits high processivity, \nits usage faces two major challenges: During initiation, the enzyme frequently \naborts transcription, producing potentially immunogenic short RNA by-products; \ntransient pausing during elongation facilitates premature termination, which \nleads to shorter transcripts and reduces the overall product yield. Here, we \npresent a single-molecule high-throughput transcription assay using DNA curtains \nto study initiation, elongation, pausing, and termination of individual \npolymerases and examine what drives transcription aborts. We introduced two \ndifferent promoter sites on the template DNA and found that transcription \ninitiation is directly influenced by the DNA shape parameters of the initiation \nregion downstream of the conserved promoter sequence. Furthermore, we showed \nthat dimethyl sulfoxide can alleviate the effects of suboptimal initiation \nsequences. During elongation, we identified two sequence-dependent pause types \nthat differ in length, of which the short pauses relate to ubiquitous pauses in \nbacterial polymerases. Longer pauses emerged by direct contact of the enzyme \nwith a recognition motif on the template and were stabilized through \ninteractions of the nascent RNA with the enzyme. These insights into \ntranscriptional initiation and pausing highlight common impediments to the \nperformance of the T7 RNAP transcription system.\n\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.2514125122\nPMID: 41364756 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing interests statement:The authors \ndeclare no competing interest.'},

Here, we engineered geraniol-producing E. \ncoli strains with isogenic plasmid DNAs differing only in promoter architecture \n(Trc vs. T7, single vs. dual promoter) to dissect transcriptional versus \ntranslational contributions to plasmid instability. Dual promoter-driven strains \nexhibited acute production failure (92.1-94.8% reduction in peak geraniol \ntiters) compared to the single Trc promoter control, accompanied by acute growth \ninhibition (34.6-37.9% lower specific growth rates). Remarkably, >\u200953% of this \nmetabolic burden persisted after RBS/MCS deletion (calculated as [growth \ninhibition in S528]/[inhibition in S493] × 100%), directly linking instability \nto transcription initiation rather than protein synthesis. Promoter strength \ninversely correlated with plasmid retention: dual-T7 constructs reduced plasmid \nstability to 45.0\u2009±\u20099.5% within 12\xa0h post-induction, while Trc systems \nmaintained 80.0\u2009±\u20094.8% retention. Partial host adaptation restored cell growth \n(47% recovery by 12\xa0h), but geraniol titer remained severely suppressed (21.7% \nof control), revealing irreversible metabolic flux imbalances. These findings \nreveal that strong promoters induce plasmid instability primarily through \ntranscription-initiated burden, distinct from translational costs. Our work \nprovides a genetic uncoupling strategy to quantify this burden and guides \npromoter optimization for stable microbial terpenoid production.\n\n© 2025.

In this study tandem mass tag (TMT)-based quantitative \nproteomics revealed extensive proteome remodeling, with 175 and 120 \ndifferentially expressed proteins (DEPs) after treatment with L3 and L3-K, \nrespectively. L3 induced predominantly upregulated responses linked to \nmetabolism, RNA processing, transport, and homeostasis, whereas L3-K mainly \ncaused the downregulation of proteins involved in metabolism, transport, and \ncell structure. Both peptides disrupted ABC transporter-mediated nutrient uptake \nand elicited stress responses, while L3 specifically perturbed the mal regulon, \nindicative of broader transcriptional dysregulation. Complementary fluorescent \ndye displacement and in vitro transcription/translation assays demonstrated \nnonspecific DNA binding, stronger for L3 than L3-K, and potent inhibition of \ntranscriptional and translational processes. Strikingly, inhibitory \nconcentrations paralleled their minimum inhibitory concentrations, directly \nlinking DNA binding and interference with central information processing to \nantimicrobial activity. These findings reveal that L3 and L3-K primarily act by \ntargeting DNA and interfering with the transcription-translation machinery. \nBeyond offering mechanistic insights, this study underscores peptides' potential \nto act as scaffolds for next-generation antimicrobial peptides with DNA-binding \nand nonmembrane-lytic activity.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.5c01000\nPMID: 41363146"}]},

This study investigates \nthe roles of Escherichia coli (E. coli)-encoded Lon protease in the metabolism \nof 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), a toxic industrial compound. Enhanced conversion \nof yellow-colored 2,4-DNP to a reddish-brown product was observed in a strain \nlacking Lon protease (Δlon). This observation led us to characterize and \nunderstand the mechanisms of 2,4-DNP metabolism. UV-visible and LC-MS analyses \nrevealed differences in the conversion products between the wild-type and Δlon. \nOne of the substrates of Lon protease is MarA, a transcription factor, and \nstudies with different mutants followed by trans complementation demonstrated \nMarA-dependent conversion. The bathochromic shift of spectral peaks suggested \nreduction processes and possible involvement of nitroreductase enzymes. Indeed, \nthe expression of two genes encoding nitroreductases, nfsA and nfsB, increased \nwith 2,4-DNP and was dependent on MarA. Importantly, the production of the \nreddish-brown product was lower in strains lacking nfsA or nfsB. Finally, LC-MS \nanalysis identified one of the conversion products of 2,4-DNP to be \n4-amino-2-nitrophenol (4,2-ANP). Dose studies with purified 4,2-ANP demonstrated \nthat it did not lower the growth of E. coli (unlike 2,4-DNP) and induced \nphenotypic antibiotic resistance in an acrB-dependent (like 2,4-DNP) but in a \nmarA-independent (unlike 2,4-DNP) manner. This study revealed how E. coli in the \nenvironment converts a toxic compound (2,4-DNP) into a lesser toxic compound \n(4,2-ANP) and helps survive in the presence of antibiotics. Overall, this study \ncontributes to our understanding of biological responses to nitroaromatics.\nIMPORTANCE: E. coli is one of the common microorganisms in feces-contaminated \nsewage and often interacts with several pollutants. This study identifies the \nroles of Lon protease and its substrate MarA in inducing nitroreductases, NfsA \nand NfsB, in reducing toxic 2,4-DNP to less toxic 4,2-ANP, a novel inducer of \nphenotypic antibiotic resistance in E. coli. This study sheds light on the roles \nof E. coli-encoded Lon protease upon exposure to harmful nitroaromatics. Common \nenvironmental pollutants can act as a selective pressure, favoring the survival \nas well as proliferation of bacteria containing antibiotic-resistant genes, \nwhich can easily be transferred to other bacteria through horizontal gene \ntransfer. This study offers insights into mitigation methods in E. coli, a \nwell-characterized model. It is possible that such environmental pollution \nstrategies may be translated to other models, such as Pseudomonas, which are \ncommonly used in bioremediation studies.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/aem.01603-25\nPMID: 41364024'},

This study investigated the role of phages in \nmodulating the prevalence and seasonal patterns of major diarrheal pathogens, \nVibrio cholerae O1 (VCO1), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Shigella \nspp., and Salmonella spp. in diarrheal patients and environmental wastewater \nspecimens collected from six different sites in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2024. \nVCO1, ETEC, Shigella, and Salmonella were detected in 10.1%, 7.8%, 1.7%, and \n2.4% of diarrheal specimens, respectively. In contrast, phages targeting these \npathogens were more frequently isolated, with detection rates of 20% for VCO1, \n30% for ETEC, 57% for Shigella, and 9.2% for Salmonella-specific phages. Adults \nshowed a significantly higher burden of VCO1 and corresponding phages compared \nwith children <5 years (P < 0.001). Seasonal analysis revealed significant \ncorrelations between VCO1 (37.3%) and corresponding phages (57.6%) peaking in \nlate September in both clinical (r = 0.53, P < 0.0001) and environmental \nwastewater specimens (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The highest correlation (r = 0.68) \nwas found between the increased rate of wastewater phages in the preceding week \nand a rise in cholera cases in the following week. ETEC and ETEC phages isolated \nfrom wastewater also showed strong correlations (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). \nCross-specificity analysis demonstrated that VCO1 phages were highly specific to \ntheir targets, whereas ETEC and Shigella phages exhibited broader host ranges, \nwith some Shigella phages capable of infecting ETEC and Salmonella spp. Overall, \nthese findings support the hypothesis that Vibrio phages could serve as an \nalternative or complementary tool for cholera \nsurveillance.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the dynamics between phages and their \nbacterial hosts is critical for elucidating disease burden; however, their \npotential for surveillance remains underexplored. To our knowledge, this is the \nfirst study that longitudinally investigated major diarrheal pathogens and their \nphages in both clinical and environmental sources to assess the potential of \nbacteriophages as a tool to improve diarrheal surveillance. The high frequency \nof phages compared to the host bacterial counterparts suggests a valuable, yet \nunderutilized, role for phages in surveillance systems. Strong seasonal \nalignment between V. cholerae O1 and its phages, both peaking in late September, \nsuggests that phage dynamics may reflect pathogen transmission. These \npreliminary observations raise the possibility that wastewater-derived Vibrio \nphages could function as early indicators of cholera burden. Future research \nshould aim to explore the complex and poorly understood interactions between \nphages and their bacterial hosts, particularly how these dynamics shape pathogen \npopulations in endemic settings.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.02654-25\nPMID: 41363802'}],

Although T7 RNAP exhibits high processivity, \nits usage faces two major challenges: During initiation, the enzyme frequently \naborts transcription, producing potentially immunogenic short RNA by-products; \ntransient pausing during elongation facilitates premature termination, which \nleads to shorter transcripts and reduces the overall product yield. Here, we \npresent a single-molecule high-throughput transcription assay using DNA curtains \nto study initiation, elongation, pausing, and termination of individual \npolymerases and examine what drives transcription aborts. We introduced two \ndifferent promoter sites on the template DNA and found that transcription \ninitiation is directly influenced by the DNA shape parameters of the initiation \nregion downstream of the conserved promoter sequence. Furthermore, we showed \nthat dimethyl sulfoxide can alleviate the effects of suboptimal initiation \nsequences. During elongation, we identified two sequence-dependent pause types \nthat differ in length, of which the short pauses relate to ubiquitous pauses in \nbacterial polymerases. Longer pauses emerged by direct contact of the enzyme \nwith a recognition motif on the template and were stabilized through \ninteractions of the nascent RNA with the enzyme. These insights into \ntranscriptional initiation and pausing highlight common impediments to the \nperformance of the T7 RNAP transcription system.\n\nDOI: 10.1073/pnas.2514125122\nPMID: 41364756 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing interests statement:The authors \ndeclare no competing interest.'},

Dual promoter-driven strains \nexhibited acute production failure (92.1-94.8% reduction in peak geraniol \ntiters) compared to the single Trc promoter control, accompanied by acute growth \ninhibition (34.6-37.9% lower specific growth rates).

Data from Eastern Europe and \nthe Caucasus are scarce, limiting region-specific infection control strategies.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter surveillance study across five \ntertiary hospitals in Georgia from May 2020 to December 2023. A total of 484 \nrespiratory specimens were obtained from 397 adult patients with \nmicrobiologically confirmed NP. Pathogen identification was performed using \nculture and MALDI-TOF MS, with antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to \nCLSI guidelines. PCR assays detected major resistance genes. Epidemiological, \nmolecular, and clinical outcomes were evaluated, including temporal trends and \ncomparisons between ICU and non-ICU patients.\nRESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria predominated (71.7%), with Pseudomonas \naeruginosa (41.9%) as the leading pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus \n(21.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (13.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), and \nStreptococcus pneumoniae (9.3%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was identified in \n80% of isolates, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) phenotypes in 18.4%, and \npandrug-resistant (PDR) phenotypes in 1.4%. ESBL prevalence increased from 48.3% \nin 2020 to 79.8% in 2023 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), carbapenemase expression doubled from \n15.0% to 30.2% (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and colistin resistance rose from 2.5% to 8.5% \n(p\u2009<\u20090.05). ICU isolates showed significantly higher MDR and XDR rates than \nthose from non-ICU settings (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Thirty-day mortality correlated with \nresistance phenotype, ranging from 18.2% in susceptible infections to 71.4% in \nPDR cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: This four-year study shows high and increasing antimicrobial \nresistance among NP pathogens in Georgia, especially in ICU settings.

K. pneumoniae has two \npathotypes: classical (cKp) and hypervirulent (hvKp). CKp typically causes \nopportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals in healthcare settings \nand often is multi-drug resistant. HvKp can be community-acquired and cause \nhigh-mortality infections in immunocompetent individuals. Concerningly, \nantibiotic-resistant cKp strains with hypervirulence-associated genes and traits \nhave recently emerged. Determining if and how hv-associated genes contribute to \nincreased virulence of cKp strains is essential to addressing this growing \nthreat. The rmpADC operon is an hv-associated locus that confers \nhypermucoviscosity (HMV), a key virulence phenotype, and rmp genes are often \nfound in convergent strains. In this study, we aimed to determine if the rmp \ngenes alone could increase the virulence of cKp strains in the absence of other \nhv-associated genes. We introduced genetically distinct rmp loci from different \nlineages into a broad array of cKp isolates and found that, while many isolates \nbecame HMV positive, only a subset of these strains showed an increase in \nvirulence in a mouse model of pneumonia. Sequence type and capsule type were not \npredictive of how rmp acquisition impacted the clinical isolates. Our results \nindicate that HMV is likely necessary but not sufficient for hypervirulence and \nthat rmp sequence can influence virulence potential in cKp \nstrains.IMPORTANCEKlebsiella pneumoniae is a global pathogen, and gene exchange \nbetween hypervirulent (hvKp) and classical (cKp) strains is a rising threat. It \nis essential to understand how hvKp genes impact virulence phenotypes and \nidentify the cKp strain backgrounds most amenable to enhanced virulence. \nHypermucoviscosity (HMV) is a critical virulence factor in hypervirulent K. \npneumoniae, conferred by the rmpADC locus. The rmp genes are encoded on mobile \ngenetic elements and have been detected in convergent antibiotic-resistant K. \npneumoniae strains of concern. In this study, we explored the impact of rmp \nacquisition in a broad set of classical clinical isolates. We observed that HMV \nappears necessary, but not sufficient, for increased virulence. Sequence type, \ncapsule type, and HMV capacity could not predict which classical isolates gain \nan rmp-dependent colonization benefit. These insights increase our understanding \nof the distinctions between cKp and hvKp and further our ability to identify and \ntreat new strains of concern.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.03122-25\nPMID: 41363447'},

Statistical \nanalyses included Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and multivariable Cox \nregression. A propensity score analysis with inverse probability of treatment \nweighting (IPTW) was also performed to compare the treatment effect of \ncombination therapy versus monotherapy adjusting for imbalances between \ntreatment groups.\nRESULTS: A total of 239 patients were included. Bloodstream infections were the \nmost common (49.8%), followed by ventilator-associated and hospital-acquired \npneumonia. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common isolate (64.8%), followed \nby Klebsiella spp. (23%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.6%), and Stenotrophomonas \nmaltophilia (8.8%). Overall 30-day survival was 71% (95% CI: 65-76), with no \nsignificant differences between monotherapy and combination therapy. Independent \npredictors of higher 30-day mortality were: having received 2 or 3 previous \nlines of antibiotic therapy (aHR: 4.26, 95% CI: 1.00-18.20; aHR: 7.33, 95% CI: \n1.53-35.05), SARS-CoV-2 coinfection (aHR: 4.19, 95% CI: 2.04-8.59), and \nisolation of NDM-producing Klebsiella spp. (aHR: 6.22, 95% CI: 2.09-18.50).\nCONCLUSIONS: Real-world experience supports the role of cefiderocol as a \nvaluable option for GNBIs, with no clinical advantage of combination therapy \nover monotherapy. Notably, NDM-producing infections and use of cefiderocol as \nsalvage therapy are associated with poor outcomes, highlighting the need for \noptimised treatment strategies.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

K. pneumoniae has two \npathotypes: classical (cKp) and hypervirulent (hvKp). CKp typically causes \nopportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals in healthcare settings \nand often is multi-drug resistant. HvKp can be community-acquired and cause \nhigh-mortality infections in immunocompetent individuals. Concerningly, \nantibiotic-resistant cKp strains with hypervirulence-associated genes and traits \nhave recently emerged. Determining if and how hv-associated genes contribute to \nincreased virulence of cKp strains is essential to addressing this growing \nthreat. The rmpADC operon is an hv-associated locus that confers \nhypermucoviscosity (HMV), a key virulence phenotype, and rmp genes are often \nfound in convergent strains. In this study, we aimed to determine if the rmp \ngenes alone could increase the virulence of cKp strains in the absence of other \nhv-associated genes. We introduced genetically distinct rmp loci from different \nlineages into a broad array of cKp isolates and found that, while many isolates \nbecame HMV positive, only a subset of these strains showed an increase in \nvirulence in a mouse model of pneumonia. Sequence type and capsule type were not \npredictive of how rmp acquisition impacted the clinical isolates. Our results \nindicate that HMV is likely necessary but not sufficient for hypervirulence and \nthat rmp sequence can influence virulence potential in cKp \nstrains.IMPORTANCEKlebsiella pneumoniae is a global pathogen, and gene exchange \nbetween hypervirulent (hvKp) and classical (cKp) strains is a rising threat. It \nis essential to understand how hvKp genes impact virulence phenotypes and \nidentify the cKp strain backgrounds most amenable to enhanced virulence. \nHypermucoviscosity (HMV) is a critical virulence factor in hypervirulent K. \npneumoniae, conferred by the rmpADC locus. The rmp genes are encoded on mobile \ngenetic elements and have been detected in convergent antibiotic-resistant K. \npneumoniae strains of concern. In this study, we explored the impact of rmp \nacquisition in a broad set of classical clinical isolates. We observed that HMV \nappears necessary, but not sufficient, for increased virulence. Sequence type, \ncapsule type, and HMV capacity could not predict which classical isolates gain \nan rmp-dependent colonization benefit. These insights increase our understanding \nof the distinctions between cKp and hvKp and further our ability to identify and \ntreat new strains of concern.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.03122-25\nPMID: 41363447'},

The aim of our study is to identify the carbapenem resistance genes \nof K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples \nsent from the intensive care units of our hospital and to investigate the clonal \nrelationship among them.\nMETHODOLOGY: K. pneumoniae strains isolated from blood and CSF samples routinely \ncollected from the intensive care units of our hospital over a two-year period \nwere included in the study. Carbapenemase screening of CRKP strains was \nperformed using Carba NP and CIM tests. Additionally, carbapenemase resistance \ngenes (blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, and blaOXA-48) and clone analysis were \nperformed using AP-PCR on these strains.\nRESULTS: A total of 186 strains with reduced susceptibility to at least one \ncarbapenem were detected. In carbapenemase screening, the sensitivity of the CIM \ntest was 98.3% (169/172), specificity was 7.1% (1/14); the sensitivity of Carba \nNP was 90.7% (156/172), specificity was 78.6% (11/14). 83.9% of the strains were \nblaOXA-48, 4.8% blaNDM, and 3.8% blaKPC positive. blaIMP and blaVIM resistance \ngenes were not detected. One hundred and eighty-six K. pneumoniae isolates were \nidentified with 62 different genotypes, and isolates showing clustering were \ngrouped into 30 different clusters. The clustering rate of these isolates was \n82.8%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Resistant bacteria can cause small outbreaks in ICUs.

The \nrecent genetic evolution of K. pneumoniae has led to the emergence of strains \nexhibiting both hypervirulence and multidrug resistance (MDR). In this study, we \ncompared the genomic characteristics of MDR in classical and hypervirulent K. \npneumoniae clinical isolates. Sixty-four isolates were collected from two \nhealthcare institutions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and identified using \nstandard microbiological techniques. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed \non 30 selected isolates using an Illumina platform. The sequencing data were \nanalysed with the Kleborate tool. WGS analysis identified sequence types ST147 \n(n\u2009=\u20097, 23%) and ST2629 (n\u2009=\u20095, 16.6%) as the most prevalent lineages. \nAdditionally, 13 other ST were detected, including ST147-1LV (n\u2009=\u20091, 3.3%) and \nST859 (n\u2009=\u20091, 3.3%), which exhibited hypervirulent MDR traits. Among \nK-loci-associated virulence determinants, KL64 was the most predominant (n\u2009=\u20097, \n23%), while the O-serotype O1/O2v1 was found in 22 isolates. A diverse range of \nantimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants was observed across isolates. \nPlasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes (qnrS1, qnrB1, qnrB4, qepA2) \nand aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib-cr, strA, strB) \nwere detected in both classical and hypervirulent strains. β-lactamase genes \nincluded bla-SHV variants (bla-SHV-1, bla-SHV-11, bla-SHV-25, bla-SHV-187), \nbla-CTX-M-15, bla-VEB-5, bla-OXA-1, bla-OXA-48, and bla-OXA-181. Additional \nresistance genes conferred resistance to macrolides (ermB, mphB), phenicols \n(catB4, catA1, floR), sulfonamides (sul1, sul2), tetracyclines (tetA, tetB, \ntetD), and trimethoprim (dfrA1, dfrA12, dfrA14). Acquired AmpC and other \nβ-lactamases (DHA-1, TEM-1D, CMH-1, CMY-6, LAP-2, AmpC1) were also present. The \nmost prevalent plasmid replicons were Col(pHAD28), IncFIB(K), and IncR, with the \nhypervirulent ST147-1LV isolate carrying the highest number. These findings \nunderscore the significant public health threat posed by hypervirulent and MDR \nK. pneumoniae strains, highlighting the extensive burden of virulence and \nresistance genes that complicate treatment strategies.\n\n© 2025.

Exclusion criteria included secondary NS and eGFR\u2009<\u200960\xa0mL/min/1.73\xa0m2 \nat the time of vaccination. Baseline characteristics and seroconversion titres \n(VZV-IgG\u2009≥\u2009110\xa0IU/L) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit were \nassessed.\nRESULTS: Two-hundred children with idiopathic NS (55.5% males) received \nvaricella vaccine. The median interval between doses was 3\xa0months [IQR 2, 7], \nwith a median age at vaccination of 6.8\xa0years [3.8, 9.8], and a median illness \nduration of 4.1\xa0years [1.7, 6.6]. Overall seroconversion rate was 64.5% with \nmedian VZV-IgG titres of 179 [IQR 62, 452] IU/L. The seroconversion was \nsignificantly associated with clinical phenotype when unadjusted for \nconfounders. On univariate analysis, each additional relapse, children on \nlevamisole post-vaccination, those on one second-line immunosuppressive agent, \non two second-line immunosuppressive agents, and each additional month after \nvaccination were associated with 16%, 88%, 66%, 77%, and 3% significantly lower \nodds of seroconversion. The seroconversion rates or titres among those \nvaccinated within 4\xa0weeks of discontinuation of steroids were however not \nsignificantly different. Breakthrough varicella occurred in 1.5%.\nCONCLUSIONS: To conclude, this study demonstrates that varicella vaccination \nconfers seroprotection in approximately two-thirds of children with NS, with low \nrates of breakthrough varicella.\n\n© 2025.

However, well-defined \nand potent small molecule agonists for many PRRs still await discovery and \ndevelopment. Screening of chemical libraries of ~200,000 small molecules for \nmaturation of human monocytic cells by quantifying NF-κB activation and cell \nadherence was completed. From this screen, we selected a thiazole benzamide \nderivative, PVP-057, for its robust immunomodulatory properties, low toxicity \nprofile, and concentration-dependent activity. In vitro investigation of pathway \nand receptor activation reveals that PVP-057 is a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) \nagonist. As a single-component adjuvant, administered intramuscularly or \nintradermally to female mice, PVP-057 enhances long-term humoral immunogenicity \nof varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E to levels comparable to those induced \nby the clinical grade standard benchmark adjuvant, AS01B, while concurrently \ninducing cell-mediated immunity. To demonstrate the large-scale and precise \nsynthesis necessary for the efficient mass production of a small molecule \nagonist, a green chemistry approach was completed, devising a three-step, \n24-hour synthesis scheme for PVP-057, with a reliable purity of ~98%. Featuring \nhighly efficient and scalable synthesis, a distinct TLR3-dependent mechanism of \naction, and robust adjuvanticity, the PVP-057 pharmacophore has prophylactic and \ntherapeutic potential.\n\n© 2025.

Conversely, we found no statistically \nsignificant relationship between diagnostic delay and initial visual acuity. \nMoreover, 70% of patients had a retinal detachment during follow-up, and 50% of \nretinal detachments occurred within 90 days of diagnosis.\nDISCUSSION: We found no statistically significant relationship between \ndiagnostic delay and initial visual acuity, whereas the latter is dependent upon \nthe location of the area of necrosis, although we would intuitively expect the \ncentripetal progression of the necrosis to associate a delay in diagnosis with \ngreater damage. Initial visual acuity appears to be a major prognostic factor.\nCONCLUSION: Acute retinal necrosis is a rare and serious pathology, the visual \nprognosis of which appears to be primarily related to the area of initial \nnecrosis and initial visual acuity.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

A 27-year-old adult \nBlack African male health care worker presented with severe headache, \nintermittent weakness and inability to walk, intermittent nausea, fever, \nshortness of breath, itching, pruritus, lesions with pus on the skin, sleep \ndisturbances, and nightmares for two days. In this case report, the patient's \nface, neck, and scapulae were the most infected areas of the body, and the rest \nof the body, except the legs, hands, genital areas, and buttocks, was also \nhighly infected. Chickenpox was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction \n(PCR), positive IgM, viral culture, and low IgG. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five \ntimes a day, was given for ten days to treat chickenpox infection because \nacyclovir inhibits varicella zoster virus replication. It is typically unable to \neradicate VZV from the latent state in neurons. The patient showed marked \nimprovement within a week and fully recovered without complications or \npost-herpetic sequelae.

This study designed and evaluated \nthe performance of an in-house multiplex real-time PCR for simultaneous \ndetection of these viruses. Materials and Methods: Plasma samples from 270 \ntransplant patients were tested using an in-house multiplex real-time PCR assay \nspecifically designed for HSV, VZV, and EBV. Analytical specificity and the \nassay's limit of detection (LOD) were determined. Statistical analyses were \nperformed to evaluate the agreement between the in-house assay and the reference \nkit. Results: The method had a specificity of 98% for HSV, 97% for VZV, and 95% \nfor EBV, alongside 100% sensitivity for all three viruses. No cross-reactivity \nwas observed with other viral or bacterial DNA. The LOD for the in-house assay \nwas determined to be 6.25, 25, and 25 copies/mL for HSV, VZV, and EBV, \nrespectively. Additionally, precision analysis showed low CV values in both \nintra-assay and interassay evaluations (HSV: 1.5%-1.8%; VZV: 2.3%-2.6%; and EBV: \n3.7%-3.9%), confirming the assay's robust analytical precision. Bland-Altman \nanalysis showed mean differences of 1.35, -3.29, and 1.75 for HSV, VZV, and EBV, \nrespectively. This multiplex real-time PCR method enables detection at lower \nconcentrations. Cross-reactivity testing confirmed no interaction with DNA from \nother viruses or nontarget microorganisms. Bland-Altman and linear regression \nanalyses also showed a strong agreement between commercial and in-house methods. \nConclusion: These findings, compared to Altona diagnostic kits, highlight the \nvalue of designing and applying advanced diagnostic assays in managing viral \ninfections in transplant patients.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Reyhaneh Kalhor et al.

Observational studies suggest a potential \nassociation between gut microbiota changes and both the infection and \nneuropathic pain, yet causality remains uncertain. This study conducted a \nbidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summarized data from \npublicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the gut microbiota, \nzoster infection, and PHN. To ascertain causality, we used 5 MR methods centered \non Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW), supported by sensitivity analyses, for the \nrobustness of the results. We conducted a bidirectional MR analysis. MR analysis \nsuggested a potential causal relationship between the gut microbiota and zoster \ninfection. A lower risk of HZ was found for the family Bifidobacteriaceae, \nEubacterium coprostanoligenes group, genus Prevotella7, and order \nBifidobacteriales. In contrast, the genus Lachnospiraceae UCG008 was associated \nwith higher risk. Five types of bacteria were found to protect against PHN. \nThese were from the genus Actinomyces, the genus Family XIII UCG001, the genus \nLachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, the genus Parasutterella, and the genus \nRuminococcaceae UCG011.

Antiviral \nagents are critical for controlling these infections; however, an open-access \ndatabase dedicated specifically to antiviral agents remains unavailable. Here, \nwe present AntiviralDB (https://www.antiviraldb.com/), an expert-curated \nresource that compiles both approved and experimental antiviral agents with \nlaboratory-confirmed in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of human \nviruses. These include the human immunodeficiency virus, coronaviruses, \nhepatitis viruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, herpes simplex \nvirus, varicella-zoster virus, human cytomegalovirus, human papillomavirus, \ndengue virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus, mpox virus, norovirus, chikungunya virus, \nand 16 other common or life-threatening pathogens. Each antiviral agent in the \ndatabase is annotated with key information, including its molecular target, in \nvitro antiviral activity (IC50, EC50, and CC50 across specific viral strains and \ncell lines), mechanism of action, and relevant pharmacokinetic and \npharmacodynamic parameters. AntiviralDB also provides clinical efficacy and \nsafety data derived from randomized clinical trials. Unlike existing drug \ndatabases, AntiviralDB offers two distinctive features: (i) standardized \nlaboratory protocols for antiviral drug screening under appropriate biosafety \nconditions and (ii) clinical guidelines for the therapeutic use of antiviral \nagents against viral infections. By serving as a comprehensive repository of \nantiviral agents and their clinical applications, AntiviralDB aims to advance \nantiviral drug discovery and support the effective clinical management of viral \ninfectious diseases.\nIMPORTANCE: Over the past decade, viral infectious diseases have caused \nsignificant morbidity and mortality worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for \neffective antiviral therapies. However, there is a lack of an open-access \ndatabase that consolidates detailed information on antiviral agents, clinical \nguidelines, and laboratory protocols. To address this need, AntiviralDB was \ndeveloped to integrate extensive data on antiviral agents-including clinical \nefficacy, safety profiles, pharmacokinetic parameters, and in vitro and in vivo \nactivities-together with standardized experimental protocols and clinical \ntreatment guidelines. This resource empowers researchers and clinicians to (i) \nidentify promising antiviral candidates for controlling infectious diseases, \n(ii) accelerate the discovery and development of novel therapeutics, (iii) \noptimize the clinical use of existing antiviral drugs, and (iv) enhance a quick \nresponse to emerging viral outbreaks.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.02013-25\nPMCID: PMC12506027\nPMID: 40932285 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'}],

Exclusion criteria included secondary NS and eGFR\u2009<\u200960\xa0mL/min/1.73\xa0m2 \nat the time of vaccination. Baseline characteristics and seroconversion titres \n(VZV-IgG\u2009≥\u2009110\xa0IU/L) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit were \nassessed.\nRESULTS: Two-hundred children with idiopathic NS (55.5% males) received \nvaricella vaccine. The median interval between doses was 3\xa0months [IQR 2, 7], \nwith a median age at vaccination of 6.8\xa0years [3.8, 9.8], and a median illness \nduration of 4.1\xa0years [1.7, 6.6]. Overall seroconversion rate was 64.5% with \nmedian VZV-IgG titres of 179 [IQR 62, 452] IU/L. The seroconversion was \nsignificantly associated with clinical phenotype when unadjusted for \nconfounders. On univariate analysis, each additional relapse, children on \nlevamisole post-vaccination, those on one second-line immunosuppressive agent, \non two second-line immunosuppressive agents, and each additional month after \nvaccination were associated with 16%, 88%, 66%, 77%, and 3% significantly lower \nodds of seroconversion. The seroconversion rates or titres among those \nvaccinated within 4\xa0weeks of discontinuation of steroids were however not \nsignificantly different. Breakthrough varicella occurred in 1.5%.\nCONCLUSIONS: To conclude, this study demonstrates that varicella vaccination \nconfers seroprotection in approximately two-thirds of children with NS, with low \nrates of breakthrough varicella.\n\n© 2025.

However, well-defined \nand potent small molecule agonists for many PRRs still await discovery and \ndevelopment. Screening of chemical libraries of ~200,000 small molecules for \nmaturation of human monocytic cells by quantifying NF-κB activation and cell \nadherence was completed. From this screen, we selected a thiazole benzamide \nderivative, PVP-057, for its robust immunomodulatory properties, low toxicity \nprofile, and concentration-dependent activity. In vitro investigation of pathway \nand receptor activation reveals that PVP-057 is a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) \nagonist. As a single-component adjuvant, administered intramuscularly or \nintradermally to female mice, PVP-057 enhances long-term humoral immunogenicity \nof varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E to levels comparable to those induced \nby the clinical grade standard benchmark adjuvant, AS01B, while concurrently \ninducing cell-mediated immunity. To demonstrate the large-scale and precise \nsynthesis necessary for the efficient mass production of a small molecule \nagonist, a green chemistry approach was completed, devising a three-step, \n24-hour synthesis scheme for PVP-057, with a reliable purity of ~98%. Featuring \nhighly efficient and scalable synthesis, a distinct TLR3-dependent mechanism of \naction, and robust adjuvanticity, the PVP-057 pharmacophore has prophylactic and \ntherapeutic potential.\n\n© 2025.

Chickenpox was confirmed by positive polymerase chain reaction \n(PCR), positive IgM, viral culture, and low IgG. Acyclovir 800 mg orally, five \ntimes a day, was given for ten days to treat chickenpox infection because \nacyclovir inhibits varicella zoster virus replication. It is typically unable to \neradicate VZV from the latent state in neurons.

This study designed and evaluated \nthe performance of an in-house multiplex real-time PCR for simultaneous \ndetection of these viruses. Materials and Methods: Plasma samples from 270 \ntransplant patients were tested using an in-house multiplex real-time PCR assay \nspecifically designed for HSV, VZV, and EBV. Analytical specificity and the \nassay's limit of detection (LOD) were determined. Statistical analyses were \nperformed to evaluate the agreement between the in-house assay and the reference \nkit. Results: The method had a specificity of 98% for HSV, 97% for VZV, and 95% \nfor EBV, alongside 100% sensitivity for all three viruses. No cross-reactivity \nwas observed with other viral or bacterial DNA. The LOD for the in-house assay \nwas determined to be 6.25, 25, and 25 copies/mL for HSV, VZV, and EBV, \nrespectively. Additionally, precision analysis showed low CV values in both \nintra-assay and interassay evaluations (HSV: 1.5%-1.8%; VZV: 2.3%-2.6%; and EBV: \n3.7%-3.9%), confirming the assay's robust analytical precision. Bland-Altman \nanalysis showed mean differences of 1.35, -3.29, and 1.75 for HSV, VZV, and EBV, \nrespectively. This multiplex real-time PCR method enables detection at lower \nconcentrations. Cross-reactivity testing confirmed no interaction with DNA from \nother viruses or nontarget microorganisms. Bland-Altman and linear regression \nanalyses also showed a strong agreement between commercial and in-house methods. \nConclusion: These findings, compared to Altona diagnostic kits, highlight the \nvalue of designing and applying advanced diagnostic assays in managing viral \ninfections in transplant patients.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Reyhaneh Kalhor et al.

Observational studies suggest a potential \nassociation between gut microbiota changes and both the infection and \nneuropathic pain, yet causality remains uncertain. This study conducted a \nbidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summarized data from \npublicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the gut microbiota, \nzoster infection, and PHN. To ascertain causality, we used 5 MR methods centered \non Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW), supported by sensitivity analyses, for the \nrobustness of the results. We conducted a bidirectional MR analysis. MR analysis \nsuggested a potential causal relationship between the gut microbiota and zoster \ninfection. A lower risk of HZ was found for the family Bifidobacteriaceae, \nEubacterium coprostanoligenes group, genus Prevotella7, and order \nBifidobacteriales. In contrast, the genus Lachnospiraceae UCG008 was associated \nwith higher risk. Five types of bacteria were found to protect against PHN. \nThese were from the genus Actinomyces, the genus Family XIII UCG001, the genus \nLachnospiraceae NK4A136 group, the genus Parasutterella, and the genus \nRuminococcaceae UCG011.

Antiviral \nagents are critical for controlling these infections; however, an open-access \ndatabase dedicated specifically to antiviral agents remains unavailable. Here, \nwe present AntiviralDB (https://www.antiviraldb.com/), an expert-curated \nresource that compiles both approved and experimental antiviral agents with \nlaboratory-confirmed in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of human \nviruses. These include the human immunodeficiency virus, coronaviruses, \nhepatitis viruses, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, herpes simplex \nvirus, varicella-zoster virus, human cytomegalovirus, human papillomavirus, \ndengue virus, Zika virus, Ebola virus, mpox virus, norovirus, chikungunya virus, \nand 16 other common or life-threatening pathogens. Each antiviral agent in the \ndatabase is annotated with key information, including its molecular target, in \nvitro antiviral activity (IC50, EC50, and CC50 across specific viral strains and \ncell lines), mechanism of action, and relevant pharmacokinetic and \npharmacodynamic parameters. AntiviralDB also provides clinical efficacy and \nsafety data derived from randomized clinical trials. Unlike existing drug \ndatabases, AntiviralDB offers two distinctive features: (i) standardized \nlaboratory protocols for antiviral drug screening under appropriate biosafety \nconditions and (ii) clinical guidelines for the therapeutic use of antiviral \nagents against viral infections. By serving as a comprehensive repository of \nantiviral agents and their clinical applications, AntiviralDB aims to advance \nantiviral drug discovery and support the effective clinical management of viral \ninfectious diseases.\nIMPORTANCE: Over the past decade, viral infectious diseases have caused \nsignificant morbidity and mortality worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for \neffective antiviral therapies. However, there is a lack of an open-access \ndatabase that consolidates detailed information on antiviral agents, clinical \nguidelines, and laboratory protocols. To address this need, AntiviralDB was \ndeveloped to integrate extensive data on antiviral agents-including clinical \nefficacy, safety profiles, pharmacokinetic parameters, and in vitro and in vivo \nactivities-together with standardized experimental protocols and clinical \ntreatment guidelines. This resource empowers researchers and clinicians to (i) \nidentify promising antiviral candidates for controlling infectious diseases, \n(ii) accelerate the discovery and development of novel therapeutics, (iii) \noptimize the clinical use of existing antiviral drugs, and (iv) enhance a quick \nresponse to emerging viral outbreaks.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.02013-25\nPMCID: PMC12506027\nPMID: 40932285 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'}],

Furthermore, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 \n(COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent reported ocular diseases have fundamentally \nchanged the landscape of VIOD epidemiology and management. Epidemiological data \nindicate heterogeneous effects on common infections such as Adenoviral \nconjunctivitis due to varying compliance with hygiene measures. Concurrently, \nsystemic immunological events, notably those induced by COVID-19 infection or \ncertain vaccinations, have been linked to the reactivation of latent \nAlphaherpesviruses, including Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella Zoster \nVirus (VZV). The metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) offers a \nsignificantly improved diagnostic yield (up to 92.7\xa0% in some cohorts) for \ncomplex infectious keratitis compared to conventional methods, providing an \nunbiased tool crucial for timely, targeted treatment. Therapeutic challenges are \ndefined by the persistent threat of antiviral resistance, primarily driven by \nmutations in the viral Thymidine Kinase (TK) gene. To overcome poor ocular \nbioavailability, novel drug delivery systems (NDDS), such as Acyclovir-loaded \nNiosomes and Cubosomes, show promise by enabling sustained drug release and \nenhanced corneal permeation. Effective future VIOD control requires a \nmulti-pronged strategy integrating robust global surveillance, rapid deployment \nof advanced molecular diagnostics, and the clinical implementation of \nresistance-beating therapies delivered via optimized nanocarrier platforms. This \nreview provides the current understanding of VIODs, focusing on the \nepidemiological shifts observed post-2020, advancements in molecular \ndiagnostics, challenges posed by antiviral resistance, and the emergence of \nnext-generation therapeutic strategies.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

However, its role in central \nnervous system (CNS) infections in Vietnam has not been investigated.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 330 \npatients hospitalized with suspected CNS infections at four tertiary hospitals \nin Northern Vietnam. Extensive diagnostics, including CSF culture, multiplex \npolymerase chain reaction (PCR), customized PCR assays, and 16S nanopore \nsequencing, identified a pathogen in 27% of cases. All samples were additionally \nscreened for HEV RNA using nested PCR targeting the ORF1 region.\nRESULTS: No HEV RNA was detected in this study. In our previous investigations, \nthe most common pathogens identified were Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Klebsiella \npneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria \nmeningitidis, Acinetobacter baumannii, herpes simplex virus type 1, and \nvaricella-zoster virus. These findings suggest that HEV is unlikely to play a \nmajor role in CNS infections in this setting, although the lack of serological \ntesting and genotyping limits interpretation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Given evidence of HEV genotype 3 circulation in Vietnam, future \nprospective studies combining molecular and serological approaches are warranted \nto clarify the potential contribution of HEV to neurological disease.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.ijregi.2025.100793\nPMCID: PMC12639836\nPMID: 41280343\n\nConflict of interest statement: All authors have no conflict of interest.

Here, we investigated VZV among the \nmpox-suspected cases, May to October 2022, in Ethiopia. Samples were collected \nfrom 202 mpox-suspected cases in 11 of Ethiopia's 14 regions and screened for \nmpox virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Then, differential \ntesting of other selected orthopoxviruses, VZV and herpes simplex virus (HSV) \nwere conducted for 133 randomly selected samples. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) \nand downstream analysis was performed on 8 VZV-positive samples. Descriptive \nstatistics were used to summarize epidemiological and clinical data. All the 202 \nenrolled cases tested negative for mpox. Of these, 133 samples were tested for \nVZV, and 107 (80.5%, 95% CI: 72.9% - 86.3%) turned positive but remained \nnegative for HSV and other tested orthopoxviruses. At least one VZV-positive \ncase was reported in each region sampled. Half (49.6%) of the cases were \nhospitalized, with no fatalities. The sequences were clustered primarily in \nClade 5 (62.5%, 5) followed by Clade 3 (25.0%, 2) and Clade 1 (12.5%, 1). This \ninvestigation confirmed VZV as the predominant causative agent among \nmpox-suspected cases. To our knowledge, this represents the first clade-level \ngenomic characterization of VZV from Ethiopia, revealing circulation of multiple \nclades among samples collected during May to October 2022. The findings \nhighlight the need to strengthen differential diagnostic capacities including \nmultiplex testing, and building genomic surveillance capacities for epidemic \nintelligence and outbreak response.\n\n© 2025.

Using two \nstrains, Brevibacterium casei EB3 and Pseudomonas oryzihabitans RL18, we \nevaluated their effects on plant performance and microbial community dynamics \nunder pot and pilot-scale tank conditions. Inoculation with RL18 alone \nsignificantly increased nitrogen accumulation in pot trials. At the same time, \nco-inoculation with EB3 and RL18 yielded the greatest improvements in tank \nsystems, including a 1.7-fold increase in nitrogen extraction and a threefold \nrise in biomass. Elemental analysis revealed enhanced uptake of B, Ca, Cu, and \nMg in inoculated plants, supporting improved physiological performance. DGGE \nfingerprinting combined with dendrogram analysis, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity \nmatrices, and multivariate statistics (PERMANOVA, PCA) demonstrated significant \nshifts in the root-associated microbial community due to inoculation and system \ntype. These results highlight strain-specific and context-dependent responses, \nreinforcing the need for tailored microbial strategies in integrated \nmulti-trophic aquaculture (IMTA).

These regions \nare inhabited by a large number of Coleopteran insects, which play an important \nrole in the ecological cycle. However, little is known about the endosymbiotic \nmicrobial taxa and their biological characteristics in these insects. A study of \nendosymbiotic microorganisms of Coleoptera from Xinjiang, a typical arid and \ninland saline area, revealed that endosymbiont bacteria with salinity tolerance \nare common among the endosymbionts of Coleoptera. Functional prediction of the \nmicrobiota analysis indicated a higher abundance of inorganic ion transporters \nand metabolism in these endosymbiont strains. Screening was conducted on the \ntolerable 11% NaCl levels of Brevibacterium casei G20 (PRJNA754761), and \ndifferential metabolite and proteins were performed. The differential \nmetabolites of the strain during the exponential and plateau phases were found \nto include benzene compounds, organic acids, and their derivatives. These \nresults suggest that the endosymbiotic microorganisms of Coleoptera in this \nenvironment have adaptive evolution to extreme environments, and this group of \nmicroorganisms is also one of the important resources for mining saline and \nalkaline-tolerant chassis microorganisms and high-robustness enzymes.\nIMPORTANCE: Coleoptera insects, as the first largest order of insect class, have \nthe characteristics of a wide variety and wide distribution. The arid and \nsemi-arid climate makes it more adaptable. By studying the endosymbiont bacteria \nof Coleoptera insects, we can systematically understand the adaptability of \nendosymbiont bacteria to host and special environment. Through the analysis of \nendosymbiont bacteria of Coleoptera insects in different saline-alkali areas in \narid and semi-arid regions of Xinjiang, it was found that bacteria in different \nhost samples were resistant to saline-alkali stress. These results suggest that \nbacteria and their hosts co-evolved in response to this climate. Therefore, this \nstudy is of great significance for understanding the endosymbiont bacteria of \nColeoptera insects and obtaining extremophile resources (Saline-alkali-resistant \nchassis strains with modification potential for the production of bulk chemicals \nand highly robust industrial enzymes).\n\nDOI: 10.1128/spectrum.00232-24\nPMCID: PMC11302287\nPMID: 38912811 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'},

The aim of this study was to characterize the microbial ecosystem \nfrom Djeld (fresh and dried Djeld for making Bouhezza cheese) and the changes \nintroduced by Lben microflora during its preparation and to identify its role in \ncheesemaking and its safety. Two replicates of fresh and dried skin bags (FS and \nDS) were sampled and analyzed before and after contact with Lben. The \nmicrobiological results showed no pathogens. Skins observed before the addition \nof Lben were less populated 2.86 and 3.20 log CFU cm-2 than skins examined after \nthe addition of Lben (approximately 6.0 log CFU cm-2), suggesting a potential \nrole of Lben in releasing some microorganisms into the skin during its time in \nthe Djeld. However, an increase in mesophilic lactic acid bacteria and yeasts \nwas observed in Lben after different periods of interaction with the skin. \nPCR-TTGE revealed the predominance of lactic acid bacteria (Lactiplantibacillus \nplantarum, Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Staphylococcus equorum subsp. linens, \nLactococcus cremoris, Streptococcus thermophilus) and a few high-GC-content \nbacteria (Lacticaseibacillus paracasei, Brevibacterium casei). Transfer of \nseveral microbial species was observed between the goatskin bag biofilm and Lben \nduring the overnight interaction. Bands corresponding to Lacticaseibacillus \nparacasei, Brevibacterium casei, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis \nwere detected in the fresh skin profile and in Lben after contact with the fresh \nskin. Lacticaseibacillus paracasei was found in dried skin and Lben after \ncontact with dry skin. Lactobacillus helveticus and Enterococcus faecalis \nappeared in the Lben profile and persisted in Lben and the biofilm-covered dry \nskin after interaction. These results demonstrate an exchange of specific \nmicrobial populations between goatskin bag biofilm and Lben during the \ntraditional preparation method, suggesting that the diversity of goatskin \nbiofilm contributes to the microbial diversity of Lben used in the production of \nBouhezza cheese.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

These biosurfactants contained various \nfunctional groups for capturing metals. The optimized formulation by the central \ncomposite design had low surface tension and contained relatively small \nmicelles. Comparable Cu and Cr removal efficiencies of 37.8% and 38.4%, \nrespectively, were obtained after washing the sludge by shaking with a \nsonication process at a 1:4 solid-to-liquid ratio. The zeta potential analysis \nindicated the bonding of metal ions on the surface of biosurfactant micelles. \nWhen 100\xa0g/L iron oxide nanoparticles were applied to the washing agent without \npH adjustment, 83% Cu and 100% Cr were recovered. In addition, X-ray diffraction \nand X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the nanoparticles showed the oxidation of \nnanoparticles, the reduction of Cr(V) to the less toxic Cr(III), and the \nabsorption of Cu. The recovered metals could be further recycled, which will be \nbeneficial for the circular economy.\n\n© 2023.

In this context, the study focused on \nisolating and characterizing a marine actinobacterium from Ervadi Beach in the \nRamanathapuram district. The isolated strain was identified by proteomic \nfingerprinting and 16S rRNA gene analysis. The ethyl acetate crude extract of \nBrevibacterium casei VRK 1 was tested for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory \nproperties. GC-MS analysis was used to identify the bioactive metabolites. The \nclassification of bioactive metabolites, their functions, and their metabolic \npathways was screened using an in silico approach. Based on the proteomic \nfingerprinting and sequencing results, the strain was identified as \nBrevibacterium casei VRK1. Notable anti-inflammatory activity was observed at \n500\xa0µg/mL, with an inhibition percentage of 35.76%. Strong antioxidant activity \nwas also detected for DPPH and ABTS at 500\xa0µg/mL, with inhibition percentages of \n45.9% and 40.12%, respectively. GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of ten \nnovel bioactive metabolites with the highest probability values. The bioactive \nmetabolites of B. casei VRK were identified as organometalloid compounds, fatty \nacyls, steroids, carboxylic acids, and their derivatives. The metabolomics \nresults highlighted the biological functions of B. casei VRK1, including \nantidepressant, carboxylesterase, and dihydrofolate reductase inhibition. \nPathway analysis results revealed that metabolites were associated with the \nbiosynthesis of steroid hormones and fatty acids.

Gluten is a \nmajor food ingredient, infamously containing proline and glutamine-rich domains \nthat are highly resistant to digestion by mammalian proteolytic enzymes. Thus, \nadhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only known treatment for CeD, albeit \nwith many complications. Therefore, any therapy that eliminates the gluten \nimmunogenic part before it reaches the small intestine is highly desirable. \nProbiotic therapy containing gluten-degrading bacteria (GDB) and their protease \nenzymes are possibly new approaches to treating CeD. Our study aimed to identify \nnovel GDB from the duodenal biopsy of the first-degree relative (FDR) subjects \n(relatives of diseased individuals who are healthy but susceptible to celiac \ndisease) with the potential to reduce gluten immunogenicity. Using the gluten \nagar plate technique, bacterial strains Brevibacterium casei NAB46 and \nStaphylococcus arlettae R2AA77 displaying glutenase activity were screened, \nidentified, and characterized. Whole-genome sequencing found gluten-degrading \nprolyl endopeptidase (PEP) in the B. casei NAB46 genome and glutamyl \nendopeptidase (GEP) in the S. arlettae R2AA77 genome. Partially purified PEP has \na specific activity of 1.15 U/mg, while GEP has a specific activity of 0.84 \nU/mg, which are, respectively, 6- and 9-fold times higher after concentrating \nthe enzymes. Our results showed that these enzymes could hydrolyse immunotoxic \ngliadin peptides recognized in western blot using an anti-gliadin antibody. \nAdditionally, a docking model was proposed for representative gliadin peptide \nPQPQLPYPQPQLP in the active site of the enzymes, where the residues of the \nN-terminal peptide extensively interact with the catalytic domain of the \nenzymes. These bacteria and their associated glutenase enzymes efficiently \nneutralize gliadin immunogenic epitopes, opening possibilities for their \napplication as a dietary supplement in treating CeD patients.\n\nPMID: 37309172 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'},

Plants germinated \nfrom inoculated seeds were grown either in laboratory conditions or in a saline \ncrop field.

The microbiological quality of fresh shoots for \nhuman consumption as salad greens was assessed, and the persistence of the \ninoculated strains in the plant rhizosphere was confirmed by next-generation \nsequencing (Illumina) of the 16S rDNA gene. The primary metabolite profile of \nbiostimulated plants was characterized by GC-TOF-MS.In laboratory conditions, \ninoculation with the two strains Br. casei EB3 and Ps. oryzihabitans RL18 caused \nthe most significant increase in biomass production (fresh and dry weight), and \ncaused a shift in the central metabolic pathways of inoculated plants toward \namino acid biosynthesis. In the field experiment, no significant biostimulation \neffect was detected with any of the tested inoculants.

Fifty-one of these \ndistributions had been generated by multiple laboratories and 59 by single \nlaboratories. When the ECOFFinder algorithm was used to calculate the SDs, the \nmean for the multi-species group was 0.63 log2 µg ml-1, and the 51 individual \nspecies and multiple-laboratory groups were 0.68 and 0.65 log2 µg ml-1, \nrespectively.

The bioremoval rates by ES38G, ES43G, ES45G, ES50G, and ES54G were \nsignificantly influenced by metal concentration, contact time, pH, temperature, \nand bacterial strains. For example, ES43G removed 100% Ni at 5 and 50\xa0mg/L. \nES43G, ES45G, and ES54G completely (100%) removed Cr, while ES43G, ES50G and \nES54G achieved 100% Cd removal when exposed to 5 and 50\xa0mg/L.

This issue could impact fish farms, leading to \n30%-100% mortality rates and significant financial losses. This study aims to \nidentify the underlying causes of summer mortality syndrome in fish and to \nevaluate modern mitigation strategies to protect aquaculture systems \neffectively. Mortality rates of stocked fish ranged between 30% and 70%, with \nsome instances reaching 100%. The reasons behind summer mortality syndrome are \ncomplex and multifactorial. Contributing factors include pathogenic agents such \nas bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, as well as poor management practices \nand unfavorable environmental conditions. Most types of bacteria that caused \nmortality rates in many fish species were Aeromonas spp., Flexibacter \ncolumnaris, Flavobacterium columnare, Pseudomonas spp., and Enterobacteriaceae, \nnamely Edwardsiella tarda, Yersinia spp., and Streptococcus spp. To mitigate the \nimpact of this syndrome, several protective measures can be implemented. These \ninclude applying some nutritional inventions such as herbal additives, essential \noils, natural compounds, water management, antibiotics, vaccinations, modern \ntechnology, and improved management practices. By addressing these factors \ncomprehensively, the risk of summer mortality syndrome can be significantly \nreduced. This review provides further evidence regarding the effects of summer \nmortality syndrome in fish. The main causes of this phenomenon are pathogens and \npoor management.

Their emission sources and impacts on \nwater quality were assessed. A novel quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay for Acav was \ndeveloped. Pathogen tracking via qPCR was compared with microbial source \ntracking (qMST) of fecal contamination and with land use and physicochemical \ndata. Acav prevalence was highest in road runoff, with counts correlating with \nhuman, ruminant, and sewer MST markers and nutrient levels. Real-time in vitro \nassays using Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells demonstrated the infectious \npotential of these freshwater Acav cells. Paer was most abundant in brooks \nlocated in forested areas. Markers from the qPCR/qMST toolbox were used to \nestimate the\xa0relative contribution of headwaters, road runoff, and wastewater to \nstream outlets during rain events. Sewer outflows and first-order brook waters \ndraining ruminant pasture fields were identified as key sources of downstream \nmicrobial contaminants. Road runoff containing Acav and forested headwaters \nharboring Paer further explained the observed microbial profiles. These findings \nrevealed the streams\' poor hygienic status and potential health risks for humans \nand animals. The toolbox proved effective in identifying pathogen sources and \nassessing their influence on water quality, delivering critical insights for \nenhancing the management of mixed-use catchments facing increasing pressures \nfrom climate change.\n\n© 2025.

The bioremoval rates by ES38G, ES43G, ES45G, ES50G, and ES54G were \nsignificantly influenced by metal concentration, contact time, pH, temperature, \nand bacterial strains. For example, ES43G removed 100% Ni at 5 and 50\xa0mg/L. \nES43G, ES45G, and ES54G completely (100%) removed Cr, while ES43G, ES50G and \nES54G achieved 100% Cd removal when exposed to 5 and 50\xa0mg/L.

ES43G and ES45G removed 100% Cr at pH 5-7, while 100% Cr was removed by \nES50G at pH 6 and ES54G at pH 5 and 7. ES43G, ES45G and ES54G completely removed \nPb at pH 7-8, while ES54G and ES50G removed 100% Pb at pH 6 and pH 7, \nrespectively.

Water samples \nwere collected from agricultural, hospital, untreated domestic wastewater, \ntreated wastewater, and environmental inputs. Results revealed that hospital \nwastewater (HW) had microbial genera associated with the wastewater treatment \nplant; however, we were able to isolate a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella \naerogenes, Enterobacter spp. and Staphylococcus spp. Untreated domestic \nwastewater (UW) was dominated by species such as Arcobacter cryaerophilus, \nAcinetobacter johnsonii, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter lwoffii, while \ntreated wastewater (TW) showed the presence of Arcobacter cryaerophilus, \nAeromonas caviae, Prevotella copri, Arcobacter butzleri, Acinetobacter \njohnsonii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas stutzeri. Regarding ARGs, HW \ncontributed significantly to ARGs diversity, particularly genes conferring \nresistance to critical antibiotics such as meropenem and vancomycin. TW exhibits \nthe highest ARG diversity, including genes for broad-spectrum resistance to \naminoglycosides, penicillins, and cephalosporins, suggesting cumulative \ncontamination from multiple sources. These findings emphasize the importance of \nadvancing efforts to tackle this challenge in wastewater treatment practices and \nstricter regulations to mitigate the spread of antibiotic resistance and \npathogenic microorganisms in aquatic environments.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

This study investigated urban \nwastewater overflows from public streets as vectors for \nextended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)- and carbapenemase-producing \nEnterobacterales and Aeromonas in the Suquía River (Córdoba, Argentina). \nSixty-two water samples were analyzed for coliform counts, antimicrobial \nsusceptibility, and resistance genes. Horizontal gene transfer was assessed by \nconjugation. Sixty-five ESBL- and/or carbapenemase-producing isolates were \nrecovered, including six carbapenemase producers subjected to whole-genome \nsequencing (WGS). Urban wastewater exhibited coliform levels >108 MPN/100\u202fmL, \nwhile river counts increased 2-5 logs at urban and downstream sites compared to \nupstream, where no resistant strains were detected. ESBL- and/or \ncarbapenemase-producers occurred in ~70% of wastewater and river samples, mainly \nEscherichia coli harboring blaCTX-M . Carbapenemase producers carried blaKPC-2 \nor blaNDM-1 in Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, and Aeromonas caviae. WGS \nrevealed extensive resistomes, virulence genes, and plasmid replicons, including \nIncU and IncA/C2 linked to carbapenemases. Conjugation confirmed \nplasmid-mediated transfer of β-lactamase genes, and genetic context analysis \nidentified clinically recognized transposons. Notably, Enterobacter kobei and \nAeromonas caviae from the river carried blaKPC-2 on plasmidic contigs combining \nclinical and environmental elements, consistent with genetic exchange within \naquatic ecosystems and transfer of clinically significant resistance \ndeterminants to species adapted for riverine survival.

The analysis covered five fish farms: two with a recent history of \nantibiotic use and three without any antibiotic application in the six months \nprior to sampling. Tissue samples were collected from moribund fish displaying \nclinical signs such as erratic swimming, ocular hemorrhages, fin hemorrhages, \nand skin lesions during disease outbreaks in 2022 and 2023. The samples were \nanalyzed using real-time PCR, amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene \nand the ITS-1 intergenic spacer, and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. A total of 19 \nbacterial isolates were identified, with Gram-negative bacteria, particularly \nAeromonas spp., being the most prevalent. Other identified taxa included \nPlesiomonas sp., Hafnia alvei, Pseudomonas fulva, and Kluyvera intermedia, as \nwell as Gram-positive species such as Carnobacterium maltaromaticum, Lactococcus \nsp., and Enterococcus faecium. Notably, resistant strains were found in four of \nthe five farms, even in those that had not administered antibiotics, suggesting \nthat environmental contamination and anthropogenic factors may significantly \ncontribute to the spread of resistance. Environmental stressors-such as sudden \nincreases in water temperature and high turbidity caused by suspended organic \nmatter-appeared to precede mortality peaks. The findings highlight the role of \nAeromonas spp. as a key bacteria associated with mortality events in S. trutta \nand underscore the multifactorial nature of antibiotic resistance in \naquaculture. No florfenicol-resistant isolates were detected in the farms where \nit is routinely used, indicating that florfenicol remains an effective \nantibiotic in aquaculture. However, the continuous and systematic monitoring of \nits use remains essential. The detection of bacteria not traditionally \nassociated with fish pathology in samples from diseased animals suggests the \nneed for further studies into their pathogenic potential. Overall, this \ndescriptive study emphasizes the importance of preventive health strategies, \nprudent antibiotic use, and environmental monitoring to mitigate bacterial \ndiseases and limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance in brown trout \nfarming.

While wastewater treatment \nplants (WWTPs) are essential for removing microorganisms and contaminants, they \nalso serve as hotspots for antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antimicrobial \nresistance genes (ARGs), facilitating their persistence and dissemination. This \nstudy investigated AMR in two WWTPs and one drinking water treatment plant \n(DWTP) in the Baix Llobregat area of Barcelona, Spain. Four sampling campaigns \nwere conducted during winter and summer 2023 across different treatment stages. \nDue to drought conditions, reclaimed water from the Baix Llobregat WWTP was \ndischarged upstream of the DWTP intake to supplement water resources for \nindirect potable reuse. A total of 991 cultivable ARB were obtained, enabling \nphenotypic and genotypic characterisation. The most prevalent included Aeromonas \nspp. (44.3\xa0%), Enterobacterales (27.9\xa0%), Pseudomonas spp. (19.1\xa0%), \nAcinetobacter spp. (4.8\xa0%), Shewanella spp. (2.2\xa0%), Stenotrophomonas spp. \n(1\xa0%), and others (0.7\xa0%). Among these, 57.3\xa0% were multidrug-resistant and \n2.7\xa0% were extensively drug-resistant. Furthermore, 34.6\xa0% produced \nextended-spectrum beta-lactamases, 14.1\xa0% harboured carbapenemase genes, and \n2.9\xa0% exhibited colistin resistance. Shotgun metagenomic analysis revealed high \ntaxonomic diversity, without dominant genera across treatment stages. The \nresistome was dominated by ARGs conferring resistance to beta-lactams, \naminoglycosides, and macrolides, alongside genes linked to biocide resistance \nand heavy metal tolerance. Spearman correlation analysis of selected sequenced \nstrains suggested a weak to moderate co-occurrence between ARGs and biocide or \nheavy metal tolerance genes.

In the present study, we aimed to \nelucidate the whole-genome sequence of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. caviae \nstrain AC1520, detailing its acquired antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and \ntheir genetic elements. Patients and Methods: The A. caviae strain AC1520 was \nisolated from a urine sample taken from a patient with urinary tract infection. \nWhole-genome sequencing was performed following strain identification and \nantimicrobial susceptibility testing. Overall, we identified ARGs, integrons, \ninsertion sequences (IS), and transposons acquired by strain AC1520, \nsystematically analyzing the genetic elements associated with these ARGs. \nResults: The A. caviae strain AC1520 contained a circular chromosome and a \nplasmid. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that this strain belonged to \nST-1056. All ARGs within this strain were distributed on the circular \nchromosome. We identified two MDR regions: (1) IS common region 1 (ISCR1) and \nclass 1 integron (IntI1) elements associated with aadA16, aac(6')-Ib-cr, catB3, \nqacE (two copies), sul1 (two copies), and blaPER-3; one gene cluster structure \n(IS6100-mphR(A)-mph(A)-mrx(A)-IS26); (2) Two IntI1 elements, linked to \nant(2'')-Ia, blaOXA-10, aadA2b, aph(3'')-Ib, aph(6)-Id, ARR-2, aac(6')-Ib3, \ndfrA1, qacE, and sul1.

Laboratory evaluation revealed multiorgan \ndysfunction, and brain computed tomography (CT) demonstrated diffuse cerebral \nedema. Blood cultures became positive within seven hours, isolating Aeromonas \nhydrophila and Pseudomonas species, confirming fulminant Gram-negative \nbacteremia secondary to soft tissue infection. After a period of intensive \nsupportive care, the patient improved clinically and was transferred to a burn \nunit for surgical management. This case highlights that NFCI is not confined to \nhistorical military contexts but remains a relevant contemporary clinical \nchallenge. Early recognition, aggressive supportive care, and timely surgical \nintervention are crucial to improving survival, limiting sepsis progression, \nreducing tissue loss, and preventing long-term disability.\n\nCopyright © 2025, Prucha Leite et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.96139\nPMCID: PMC12681428\nPMID: 41356899\n\nConflict of interest statement: Human subjects: Informed consent for treatment \nand open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this \nstudy.

The CaviPlasma technology utilized is based on advanced \noxidation processes induced by plasma discharge in fast-flowing liquids, \nsynergized with the hydromechanical effects of cavitation.\nRESULTS: Our results demonstrated strong biocidal efficiency of CaviPlasma water \ntreatment without chemical or medical additives. F. psychrophilum was completely \neliminated immediately after treatment, even at the lowest plasma dose \n(8.4\xa0kJ/L). Aeromonads displayed slightly higher resistance; instant elimination \nof aeromonads was achieved with a plasma dose of 25.2\xa0kJ/L, or 33.6\xa0kJ/L. \nHowever, during post-treatment incubation, the concentration of live aeromonads \ngradually decreased to zero, even at the lowest plasma dose.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study revealed that CaviPlasma technology is a promising \nsanitization method with potential for use in recirculation aquaculture systems \n(RAS). It offers approximately m3/h treatment performance and the potential to \ngreatly limit the environmental burden and long-term side effects, such as \nacquired bacterial resistance due to persistent chemical residues associated \nwith common sanitization technologies that utilize antibiotics or chemical \ntreatment of RAS.\n\n© 2025.

However, the \nsequence characteristics, antimicrobial properties, and antimicrobial mechanisms \nof some key ALF members in Procambarus clarkii have not yet been well clarified. \nIn the present study, anti-lipopolysaccharide factor 1 from P. clarkii (PcALF1) \nwas firstly identified, then its antibacterial characteristics and potential \nantibacterial mechanism was investigated. PcALF1 is 1271 bp in full length and \nencodes 122 amino acids, and contains a conserved lipopolysaccharides binding \ndomain (LBD) consisting of 24 amino acids. Pc\u200cALF1 is widely expressed in \nvarious tissues of P. clarkii, particularly in immune-related tissues, such as \nhemocytes and hepatopancreas. Upon bacterial infection, PcALF1 expression \nsignificantly increases, with a lower response level to G- bacteria compared to \nG+ bacteria. Both recombinant PcALF1 (rPcALF1) or synthetic LBD peptides (LBD1) \nshowed broad antimicrobial activity towards two G+ bacteria and three G- \nbacteria, additionally, their bactericidal effect were more potent against G- \nspecies compared to G+ counterparts. PcALF1 knockdown impairs host defense \nagainst Aeromonas hydrophila, whereas exogenous supplementation of either \nrPcALF1 or LBD1 restores immune function. Surprisingly, PcALF1 exerted \nsignificant regulatory effects on the intestinal microbiota, leading to a shift \nin the composition of the diseased intestinal microbiota towards a healthy \nstate. We further investigated the bactericidal mechanisms of rPcALF1 and LBD1 \nagainst A. hydrophila. The antibacterial effect against A. hydrophila was \ncharacterized by irreversible membrane damage, resulting in cytoplasmic leakage \nand bacterial deformation, as observed via electron microscopy. Notably, \ntranscriptomic analysis indicated a multi-target action on central metabolism \nand transport, pointing to a mechanism that may inherently circumvent \ntraditional resistance pathways. In summary, PcALF1 is expected to become an \neffective antibacterial agent, particularly crucial for treating P. clarkii \ninfected with A. hydrophila.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

However, detailed pediatric data concerning this organism remains \nscarce. We describe a 16-year-old male patient with aplastic anemia and leukemia \nwho developed persistent fever and abdominal pain following the consumption of \npartially cooked freshwater fish. Initial antibiotic therapy proved ineffective, \nand imaging studies revealed a liver abscess. Although initial pus culture \nmisidentified the pathogen as Aeromonas hydrophila, mNGS subsequently confirmed \nthe presence of A. dhakensis in blood and pus samples. After adjusting the \nantibiotic regimen and performing abscess drainage, the patient's condition \nimproved significantly, leading to his eventual discharge. A. dhakensis, while \nan uncommon cause of bacteremia, is often misidentified as A. hydrophila. This \ncase highlights the importance of accurate species identification and \nunderscores the need for further research to fully understand the distribution \nand clinical implications of A. dhakensis infections.\n\n© 2025 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.idcr.2025.e02394\nPMCID: PMC12636375\nPMID: 41282500\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no known \ncompeting financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared \nto influence the work reported in this paper"},

The \nubiquitous distribution of septins and their role in immune defense in \nvertebrates indicate their potential practical applications. Although their \nbiological importance is well recognized, the functional role of septins in \nimmune defense, particularly septin 6 in Indian major carps and other fish \nspecies, remains poorly understood. The full-length septin 6 cDNA was \nsuccessfully cloned from rohu (Labeo rohita) comprising a 1203\xa0bp open reading \nframe, and the phylogenetic analysis showed strong sequence similarity with \nseptin 6 of Anabarilius grahami (99\xa0%). It was predominantly expressed in brain, \nspleen, heart and gills, and during the early developmental stages. Its \ntranscriptional expression was significantly enhanced in three pathogen models, \nArgulus siamensis, poly I:C, and Aeromonas hydrophila, indicating a potential \nrole in immune defense. The intraperitoneal exposure of recombinant protein of \nseptin 6 (~46\xa0kDa) in rohu modulated the expression of immune-linked genes. \nFurthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated a strong protective immunity, with \n91\xa0% relative percentage survival against A. hydrophila, and reduced and delayed \nmortality (up to five days) in A. siamensis infection. A developed indirect \nELISA with a sensitivity of 2\xa0ng/mL revealed higher concentrations of septin 6 \nin liver, spleen, and brain tissues of rohu following A. hydrophila challenge. \nThis work provides the first functional characterization of septin 6 in rohu, \ndemonstrating its critical role in regulating immune responses and highlighting \nits potential in fish health management in aquaculture.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The Open Reading Frame (ORF) of OnCD94 is 681 bp \nand encodes 226 amino acids, lacks a signal peptide and contains a carbohydrate \nrecognition domain (CRD) spanning amino acids 99-223. Multiple sequence \nalignment revealed that OnCD94 shares 17.39-91.59\xa0% similarity with CD94 from \nother species. Phylogenetic analysis grouped fish CD94 into a distinct category. \nReal-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that OnCD94 is \nexpressed across all tissues examined, with the highest levels detected in the \nspleen, head kidney, blood, and non-specific cytotoxic cells (NCCs) -innate \nlymphocytes in teleost fish considered functional analogs of mammalian natural \nkiller (NK) cells, are characterized by their innate cytotoxic capacity against \ntumor cells, virus-infected cells, and parasites, and the lowest in the brain. \nInfection with Streptococcus agalactiae significantly upregulated OnCD94 \nexpression in these immune tissues and NCCs. Subcellular localization confirmed \nmembrane-anchored expressed OnCD94, which subsequently activated the NF-κB \npathway, as evidenced by dual-luciferase reporter assays. A recombinant OnCD94 \nprotein (rOnCD94) was produced. It exhibited significant binding affinity to \nvarious bacteria, including S. agalactiae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Streptococcus \niniae, Vibrio harveyi, and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as to bacterial \ncomponents such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN). The rOnCD94 \ndisplayed agglutinating effects on these bacteria, inhibited their growth, and \nenhanced macrophage phagocytosis in vitro. Furthermore, incubation of NCCs with \nrOnCD94 significantly increased the expression of NCC effectors, including \ngranzyme, perforin-1, CAS, FADD, TNF-α, FasL, and lymphotoxin-α.

In \nAlgeria, data are very limited, making investigations quite relevant. This study \naimed to determine risk factors associated with neonatal lamb mortality, \ndescribe gross and histopathological lesions on affected organs, and identify \nbacterial pathogens involved.\nDESIGN: Thirty-five sheep farms located in Constantine participated in this \nsurvey between February and December 2022. An epidemiological questionnaire was \nused to describe monitoring practices and to identify associated risk factors. \nTwenty-two collected lamb corpses (immediate postmortem changes) underwent \ndetailed postmortem examinations, including anatomopathological, \nhistopathological and microbiological analyses.\nRESULTS: The recorded neonatal mortality rate was 5.74%. Statistical analysis \nrevealed significant associations between mortality and factors such as soil and \nlivestock building hygiene, as well as the breeding system used (p\xa0<\xa00.05). The \nlungs, liver, kidneys and heart were the most affected organs. Causes of death \nincluded respiratory disorders, omphalitis with septicaemia, stillbirth, trauma \nand starvation-hypothermia syndrome. From these organs, 218 bacterial strains \nwere isolated, mainly Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella \npneumoniae, Providencia spp., Citrobacter spp.), causing primary infections, \nalongside non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, \nComamonas spp., Acinetobacter spp.), responsible for the associated septicaemic \nevolution. According to the EUCAST breakpoints, isolates were resistant to \ncommonly used antibiotics: amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, \ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. Notably, only Klebsiella spp. \nstrains harboured bla SHV genes.\nCONCLUSION: This study concluded that improved sanitary protocols, early \ndiagnosis and antimicrobial testing are crucial to prevent neonatal mortality. \nIt also recommended larger studies and farmer training programmes to enhance \nlambing and neonatal care practices.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

During a surveillance study to monitor \ncarbapenem resistance in bacteria from wastewater samples in Brazil, a \ncarbapenem-resistant strain, named M13, was obtained and identified as C. \nresistens (ANI 98.90%, dDDH 94.60%) by genomic analysis, being a species \ndistinct from C. testosteroni. It exhibited multidrug resistance and presented \nsmall inhibition zones around disks containing novel β-lactams and \nβ-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. Comparative genomics showed \nsignificant single nucleotide polymorphism divergence between M13 and other C. \nresistens genomes, suggesting geographically driven genomic diversity. Strain \nM13 uniquely harbored genes related to antimicrobial resistance and metal \ntolerance as follows: blaGES-5 (carbapenem resistance), blaOXA-17 \n(third-generation cephalosporin resistance), mer operon (mercury tolerance), and \npco operon (copper tolerance). The blaGES-5 and blaOXA-17 genes were located on \ndistinct plasmids that lacked conjugative genes but contained mobilization \nelements, indicating the potential for horizontal transfer. Unlike C. resistens \nstrains from China, M13 strain may have acquired clinically relevant \nantimicrobial resistance genes via interactions with Brazilian microbial \ncommunities. These findings highlight the relevance of monitoring Comamonas \nspecies as potential reservoirs and disseminators of clinically relevant \nantimicrobial resistance genes and underscore the need for environmental \nmonitoring of carbapenem-resistant strains.\n\n© 2025.

Given the critical role of the second messenger \ncyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) in biofilm formation, targeting a reduction in \nintracellular concentrations of c-di-GMP is believed to be a key aspect in the \ndevelopment of biofilm mitigation strategies. To facilitate this effort, here, \nwe developed a transcription factor (TF)-based biosensor that integrates the TF \nFleQ from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a PR-Ppel tandem promoter. The dynamic \nrange of the biosensor was optimized by fine-tuning the TF expression. The \nbiosensor exhibited broad compatibility and effectiveness in detecting decreases \nin c-di-GMP levels across various biofilm model organisms, including strains \nlacking FleQ or its homologues, such as Escherichia coli, Shewanella oneidensis, \nComamonas testosteroni, and Acinetobacter baumannii, as well as P. aeruginosa \ncontaining FleQ. Additionally, we monitored c-di-GMP levels in biofilms formed \nby P. aeruginosa and S. oneidensis through a ratiometric, image-based \nquantification method. The methodology used the green fluorescence protein (GFP) \nas a reporter for c-di-GMP levels and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or \nthe monomeric red fluorescence protein (mRFP) as the indicator for biofilm \nbiomass. The GFP/DAPI or GFP/mRFP ratio gives effective c-di-GMP per unit of \nbiomass. This TF-based biosensor provides an important tool to study c-di-GMP \ndynamics, which facilitates efforts in developing biofilm control strategies and \nunderstanding regulatory networks for biofilm development.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acssynbio.5c00193\nPMID: 40378340 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"}],

This study investigated the microbial diversity and \nenzymatic potential of microorganisms isolated from plastic-contaminated \ndumpsites located in Mazamitla, Jalisco a west-central region of Mexico. \nMicrobial diversity was assessed through metataxonomic analysis based on 16S \nrRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from soil samples. A total of 946 genera \nacross 49 phyla were identified, with Actinobacteria, Pseudomonadota, Bacillota, \nBacteroidota, and Acidobacteria as the most dominant, while at genus level, \nPseudomonas, Bacillus, and Streptomyces were the most representative. Culturable \nmicroorganisms were isolated, identified, and screened from soil samples for \nenzymatic activities associated with plastic degradation. From these, 280 \nmesophilic isolates were recovered, of which 251 were successfully identified. \nAmong them, 94\xa0% belonged to the domain Bacteria, primarily from the phyla \nBacillota and Pseudomonadota. The remaining 6\xa0% of isolates were fungi from the \nphylum Basidiomycota. During agar-based functional enzymatic screening using \nmineral oil as an inducer, Serratia marcescens demonstrated the highest \nextracellular carboxylesterase activity (240.3\xa0±\xa011.0 U/L), Comamonas \ntestosteroni (193.9\xa0±\xa02.5 U/L), and Pseudomonas koreensis (180.4\xa0±\xa08.0 U/L) \nexhibited significant esterase/lipase activities. C. testosteroni (125.6\xa0±\xa015.5 \nU/L), Chryseobacterium joostei (125.1\xa0±\xa014.2 U/L), and Bacillus mycoides \n(120.6\xa0±\xa09.9 U/L) were the most active for cutinase activity. \nLelliottiaamnigena, S. marcescens, Pseudomonaschlororaphis, and \nPseudomonaskilonensis exhibited the highest growth using plastics as the sole \ncarbon source. These results highlight the metabolic diversity and enzymatic \ncapabilities of microorganisms in plastic-contaminated soils, identifying \npromising candidates for sustainable plastic waste management.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

Their ligand-binding domains (LBDs) \nare highly diverse in terms of sequence and structure, and their ligands cover \nvarious chemical molecules that could serve as nitrogen, carbon, and energy \nsources. The mechanism of how this diverse range of LBDs senses different \nligands is essential to signal transduction. Previously, we reported that the \nchemoreceptor MCP2201 from Comamonas testosteroni CNB-1 sensed citrate and \nL-malate, altered the ligand-free monomer-dimer equilibrium of LBD to \ncitrate-bound monomer (with limited monomer) and L-malate-bound dimer, and \ntriggered positive and negative chemotactic responses. Here, we present our \nfindings, showing that D-malate binds to MCP2201, induces LBD dimerization, and \ntriggers the chemorepellent response exactly as L-malate did. A single site \nmutation, T105A, can alter the D-malate-bound LBD dimer into a monomer-dimer \nequilibrium and switch the negative chemotactic response to D-malate to a \npositive one. Differences in attractant-bound LBD oligomerization, such as \ncitrate-bound wildtype LBD monomer and D-malate-bound T105A dimer, indicated \nthat LBD oligomerization is a consequence of signal transduction instead of a \ntrigger. Our study expands our knowledge of chemoreceptor-sensing ligands and \nprovides insight into the evolution of bacterial chemoreceptors.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/ijms26104902\nPMCID: PMC12112095\nPMID: 40430039 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no competing interests.'},

One potential treatment strategy to combat these resistant \nmicroorganisms is the combination therapy like ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) and \naztreonam (ATM). The study evaluated the in vitro activity of the CZA-ATM \ncombination against 156 CR-GNB including Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli (E. \ncoli), and Pseudomonas spp. using E-strip disk diffusion, broth disk elution \n(BDE), and disk stacking plus micro-elution (DSE) method at the Department of \nMicrobiology & Immunology, Bangladesh Medical University (BMU), Bangladesh. \nAmong the 156 isolates, Klebsiella spp. was the most prevalent (62.8 %), \nfollowed by Pseudomonas spp. (30.1 %) and E. coli (7.1 %). Of these, 52.6 % \n(82/156) were identified as carbapenemases producers. The mCIM and eCIM methods \nidentified 23 (28.1 %) as serine carbapenemases and 59 (71.9 %) as metallo \nβ-lactamases (MBL) producers. Resistance rates for CZA and ATM were 74.4 % and \n94.2 % respectively. The E-strip disk diffusion method showed susceptibility in \n65.52 % of isolates, while the BDE and DSE methods demonstrated susceptibility \nin 54.31 % and 58.62 %, respectively. Resistance to the CZA-ATM combination was \nnotably high in Pseudomonas spp., likely due to non-carbapenemases mechanisms \nlike efflux pump activity or porin mutations. Compared to the E-strip disk \ndiffusion method, BDE method showed an agreement of 78.4 %, while DSE method \nexhibited an agreement of 89.7 %.

This \nreview aims to characterize the distribution of microorganisms in pressure \nulcers\xa0and secondarily to assess heterogeneity across studies and compare yields \nbetween invasive (biopsies) and noninvasive (swabs/irrigation-aspiration) \nsampling techniques with implications for antimicrobial management. PubMed, \nEmbase, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to 1 January 2025. Original \nresearch articles reporting microbiological data from pressure ulcers were \nincluded. Studies were excluded if data were incomplete, combined with other \nwound types, or derived from non-ulcer sampling sites. Risk of bias was assessed \nusing Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) V2, \nROBINS-E, and RoB 2 frameworks. Data were synthesized descriptively and \nstatistically. Twenty-eight studies (1,473 patients, 1,682 pressure ulcers, and \n4,231 microbial isolates) were included. The most frequently isolated \nmicroorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (39.7% \nof\xa0ulcers),\xa0Corynebacterium\xa0spp.\xa0(28.8%),\xa0Escherichia coli (23.1%), Proteus spp. \n(23.1%), Streptococcus spp. (22.7%), coagulase-negative\xa0Staphylococcus \n(21.6%),\xa0Enterococcus spp. (20.7%), Pseudomonas spp. (17.8%), and Bacteroides \nspp. (16.0%). On average, 2.5 isolates were reported per ulcer (range: 0.5-4.8). \nSignificant heterogeneity was observed across studies for nearly all major \norganisms (global heterogeneity: χ² = 1958.4, df = 405, p < 0.001).\xa0Swabs more \nfrequently yielded Providencia spp., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., and \nEnterobacter spp., whereas biopsies more frequently yielded Streptococcus spp., \nEnterococcus spp., and Klebsiella spp. Comparability was limited by the \ninclusion of diverse populations treated across 14 different countries over the \npast 50 years. Methodological inconsistencies in sampling and reporting \n(particularly regarding contaminants, duplicates, and anaerobes) further \ncomplicated interpretation and underscore the need for standardized protocols. \nNevertheless, findings consistently confirmed a polymicrobial flora dominated by \na small group of recurrent species. The ulcer microenvironment is dynamic and \ndistinct from culture media, complicating both diagnosis and treatment. Despite \nmarked heterogeneity, the consistent predominance of Staphylococcus aureus, \nEnterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and \nBacteroides spp. provides a valuable framework for empiric therapy. The \npotential benefits of short perioperative courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics \ntargeting these pathogens warrant further investigation, and prospective \ncontrolled trials are urgently needed.

Although it accounts for less than 10% of cases of \nexogenous endophthalmitis, it often results in poor visual outcomes or \nenucleation. The most common causative organisms include Staphylococcus spp., \nPseudomonas spp., and Fusarium spp., with rising concerns about antimicrobial \nresistance. Several risk factors have been identified, including the use of \ntopical corticosteroids, systemic immunosuppression, and fungal infections, \nparticularly those caused by Fusarium. Early and aggressive management is \nessential, combining intravitreal antimicrobials with surgery to reduce the \nmicrobiological load. When corneal opacity limits visualization, a\xa0combined \napproach involving temporary keratoprosthesis, penetrating keratoplasty, and \npars plana vitrectomy may offer a\xa0chance to salvage the eye.

In total, 41 organisms underwent antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testing and genome sequencing. Notable organisms isolated \nincluded 16 Klebsiella spp., 4 E. coli, and 4 Pseudomonas spp.\nRESULTS: Overall, we observed a low prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) \norganisms causing BSI on our unit. A fifth (4/20) of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. \nisolates carried ESBL or AmpC genes and a single P. monteilli carried the IMP-1 \ngene. At least 3/16 (19%) BSI with Klebsiella spp. were likely associated with \ntransmission between patients in nearby beds. These transmission events were \nassociated with two hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (ST412 and ST86) and a K. \naerogenes ∗002b. Half of all K. pneumoniae associated with BSI were \nhypervirulent, having K2 or K57 capsule type and the presence of iuc, iro, Rmp \ngenes.\nDISCUSSION: Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae is an emerging problem, capable of \ncausing a severe, disseminated infection. We suggest risk factors for \ntransmission may include shared equipment, environmental and PPE contamination, \nand failure of effective hand hygiene. With COVID-19 infection endemic, if \nSARS-CoV-2 patients require cohort nursing in bays with sessional use gowns, we \nrecommend these are short-sleeved, to facilitate effective hand hygiene.

Fluorescent Pseudomonas are often implicated in such \nsuppressiveness, but their genomic determinants and distribution in suppressive \nvs. non-suppressive (i.e., conducive) soils remain unclear.\nRESULTS: We investigated the taxonomic and functional diversity of Pseudomonas \npopulations from wheat rhizospheres in four agricultural soils with contrasting \nsuppressiveness to Fusarium graminearum-induced seedling disease. rpoD-based \nmetabarcoding and culture-dependent isolation revealed distinct Pseudomonas \ncommunity structures linked to soil suppressiveness. However, major phylogenetic \ngroups were shared across soils. From 406 isolates, 29 representative strains \nspanning seven subgroups of the P. fluorescens group were selected for \nwhole-genome sequencing. Comparative genomics revealed 14 putative novel \nPseudomonas genomospecies (dDDH\u2009<\u200970% with closest described type strains). \nGenomic screening revealed wide distribution of genes linked to biocontrol and \nplant-growth promotion, including siderophore biosynthesis, hormone modulation, \nphosphate solubilization, and production of antimicrobial compounds. \nBiosynthetic genes for phenazine and pyrrolnitrin were detected exclusively in \nP. chlororaphis strains isolated from suppressive soils, and rpoD alleles \ncorresponding to these strains were not found in conducive soils within our \nmetabarcoding dataset. Other traits such as hydrogen cyanide, ACC deaminase, and \nauxin biosynthesis were broadly distributed across isolates from all soils. \nFunctional assays demonstrated variable expression of predicted traits, \nindicating regulatory or environmental influence. Several strains inhibited F. \ngraminearum mycelial growth via volatile organic compounds, while two strains \nalso reduced conidia germination, including isolates from both suppressive and \nconducive soils.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Pseudomonas genomic traits important \nfor biocontrol are not restricted to suppressive soils, and that functional \nredundancy and context-dependent expression may shape the contribution of \nPseudomonas to disease suppression. Our results highlight the need for \nintegrative analyses combining community profiling, genome-based prediction, and \nphenotyping to better understand microbiome-mediated plant protection. The \nidentification of novel genomospecies and lineage-specific biosynthetic traits \nadvances our knowledge of Pseudomonas diversity in agricultural soils and \nsupports future development of targeted microbial consortia.\n\n© 2025.

This \nreview aims to characterize the distribution of microorganisms in pressure \nulcers\xa0and secondarily to assess heterogeneity across studies and compare yields \nbetween invasive (biopsies) and noninvasive (swabs/irrigation-aspiration) \nsampling techniques with implications for antimicrobial management. PubMed, \nEmbase, and the Cochrane Library were searched up to 1 January 2025. Original \nresearch articles reporting microbiological data from pressure ulcers were \nincluded. Studies were excluded if data were incomplete, combined with other \nwound types, or derived from non-ulcer sampling sites. Risk of bias was assessed \nusing Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) V2, \nROBINS-E, and RoB 2 frameworks. Data were synthesized descriptively and \nstatistically. Twenty-eight studies (1,473 patients, 1,682 pressure ulcers, and \n4,231 microbial isolates) were included. The most frequently isolated \nmicroorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (39.7% \nof\xa0ulcers),\xa0Corynebacterium\xa0spp.\xa0(28.8%),\xa0Escherichia coli (23.1%), Proteus spp. \n(23.1%), Streptococcus spp. (22.7%), coagulase-negative\xa0Staphylococcus \n(21.6%),\xa0Enterococcus spp. (20.7%), Pseudomonas spp. (17.8%), and Bacteroides \nspp. (16.0%). On average, 2.5 isolates were reported per ulcer (range: 0.5-4.8). \nSignificant heterogeneity was observed across studies for nearly all major \norganisms (global heterogeneity: χ² = 1958.4, df = 405, p < 0.001).\xa0Swabs more \nfrequently yielded Providencia spp., Pseudomonas spp., Proteus spp., and \nEnterobacter spp., whereas biopsies more frequently yielded Streptococcus spp., \nEnterococcus spp., and Klebsiella spp. Comparability was limited by the \ninclusion of diverse populations treated across 14 different countries over the \npast 50 years. Methodological inconsistencies in sampling and reporting \n(particularly regarding contaminants, duplicates, and anaerobes) further \ncomplicated interpretation and underscore the need for standardized protocols. \nNevertheless, findings consistently confirmed a polymicrobial flora dominated by \na small group of recurrent species. The ulcer microenvironment is dynamic and \ndistinct from culture media, complicating both diagnosis and treatment. Despite \nmarked heterogeneity, the consistent predominance of Staphylococcus aureus, \nEnterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., and \nBacteroides spp. provides a valuable framework for empiric therapy. The \npotential benefits of short perioperative courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics \ntargeting these pathogens warrant further investigation, and prospective \ncontrolled trials are urgently needed.

This issue could impact fish farms, leading to \n30%-100% mortality rates and significant financial losses. This study aims to \nidentify the underlying causes of summer mortality syndrome in fish and to \nevaluate modern mitigation strategies to protect aquaculture systems \neffectively. Mortality rates of stocked fish ranged between 30% and 70%, with \nsome instances reaching 100%. The reasons behind summer mortality syndrome are \ncomplex and multifactorial. Contributing factors include pathogenic agents such \nas bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, as well as poor management practices \nand unfavorable environmental conditions. Most types of bacteria that caused \nmortality rates in many fish species were Aeromonas spp., Flexibacter \ncolumnaris, Flavobacterium columnare, Pseudomonas spp., and Enterobacteriaceae, \nnamely Edwardsiella tarda, Yersinia spp., and Streptococcus spp. To mitigate the \nimpact of this syndrome, several protective measures can be implemented. These \ninclude applying some nutritional inventions such as herbal additives, essential \noils, natural compounds, water management, antibiotics, vaccinations, modern \ntechnology, and improved management practices. By addressing these factors \ncomprehensively, the risk of summer mortality syndrome can be significantly \nreduced. This review provides further evidence regarding the effects of summer \nmortality syndrome in fish. The main causes of this phenomenon are pathogens and \npoor management. Nutritional additives and vaccinations were effective ways to \nmitigate these harmful effects to maintain fish production. Further research is \nneeded to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of these mitigation strategies \nand to develop guidelines for sustainable fish farming practices under changing \nclimatic conditions.\n\n© The authors.\n\nDOI: 10.5455/javar.2025.l951\nPMCID: PMC12665324\nPMID: 41328249\n\nConflict of interest statement: The author declares that there is no conflict of \ninterest.'},

Fluorescent Pseudomonas are often implicated in such \nsuppressiveness, but their genomic determinants and distribution in suppressive \nvs. non-suppressive (i.e., conducive) soils remain unclear.\nRESULTS: We investigated the taxonomic and functional diversity of Pseudomonas \npopulations from wheat rhizospheres in four agricultural soils with contrasting \nsuppressiveness to Fusarium graminearum-induced seedling disease. rpoD-based \nmetabarcoding and culture-dependent isolation revealed distinct Pseudomonas \ncommunity structures linked to soil suppressiveness. However, major phylogenetic \ngroups were shared across soils. From 406 isolates, 29 representative strains \nspanning seven subgroups of the P. fluorescens group were selected for \nwhole-genome sequencing. Comparative genomics revealed 14 putative novel \nPseudomonas genomospecies (dDDH\u2009<\u200970% with closest described type strains). \nGenomic screening revealed wide distribution of genes linked to biocontrol and \nplant-growth promotion, including siderophore biosynthesis, hormone modulation, \nphosphate solubilization, and production of antimicrobial compounds. \nBiosynthetic genes for phenazine and pyrrolnitrin were detected exclusively in \nP. chlororaphis strains isolated from suppressive soils, and rpoD alleles \ncorresponding to these strains were not found in conducive soils within our \nmetabarcoding dataset. Other traits such as hydrogen cyanide, ACC deaminase, and \nauxin biosynthesis were broadly distributed across isolates from all soils. \nFunctional assays demonstrated variable expression of predicted traits, \nindicating regulatory or environmental influence. Several strains inhibited F. \ngraminearum mycelial growth via volatile organic compounds, while two strains \nalso reduced conidia germination, including isolates from both suppressive and \nconducive soils.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that Pseudomonas genomic traits important \nfor biocontrol are not restricted to suppressive soils, and that functional \nredundancy and context-dependent expression may shape the contribution of \nPseudomonas to disease suppression. Our results highlight the need for \nintegrative analyses combining community profiling, genome-based prediction, and \nphenotyping to better understand microbiome-mediated plant protection. The \nidentification of novel genomospecies and lineage-specific biosynthetic traits \nadvances our knowledge of Pseudomonas diversity in agricultural soils and \nsupports future development of targeted microbial consortia.\n\n© 2025.

In total, 41 organisms underwent antimicrobial \nsusceptibility testing and genome sequencing. Notable organisms isolated \nincluded 16 Klebsiella spp., 4 E. coli, and 4 Pseudomonas spp.\nRESULTS: Overall, we observed a low prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) \norganisms causing BSI on our unit. A fifth (4/20) of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. \nisolates carried ESBL or AmpC genes and a single P. monteilli carried the IMP-1 \ngene. At least 3/16 (19%) BSI with Klebsiella spp. were likely associated with \ntransmission between patients in nearby beds. These transmission events were \nassociated with two hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (ST412 and ST86) and a K. \naerogenes ∗002b. Half of all K. pneumoniae associated with BSI were \nhypervirulent, having K2 or K57 capsule type and the presence of iuc, iro, Rmp \ngenes.\nDISCUSSION: Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae is an emerging problem, capable of \ncausing a severe, disseminated infection. We suggest risk factors for \ntransmission may include shared equipment, environmental and PPE contamination, \nand failure of effective hand hygiene. With COVID-19 infection endemic, if \nSARS-CoV-2 patients require cohort nursing in bays with sessional use gowns, we \nrecommend these are short-sleeved, to facilitate effective hand hygiene.

While genotype-to-phenotype relationships \nare known for specific insecticidal genes on individual insect hosts, whether \nthese mechanisms will be effective on a phylogenetically distinct insect host is \nnot always known. To determine if known virulence genes are effective on a new \nhost, we developed a method to merge existing mechanistic knowledge with in vivo \ntests on a small number of bacterial isolates to predict bacterial genes \nassociated with entomopathogenesis. We used a model consisting of Drosophila \nmelanogaster interactions with pathogenic and commensal genome-sequenced strains \nof Pseudomonas bacteria. We compiled a database of previously described \ninsecticidal and biocontrol genes within the Pseudomonas genus and used \ncomparative genomics to probe the distribution of these genes across Pseudomonas \nstrains. We found natural variation in the presence of known insecticidal genes \nacross the genus. We tested the insect-killing capacity of 13 Pseudomonas spp. \nstrains against D. melanogaster and found natural variation in insecticidal \nactivity. To identify bacterial genes associated with fly mortality, we employed \ntwo statistical models to correlate bacterial virulence with the presence of \npreviously described insecticidal activity. To validate our predictions, we used \na P. aeruginosa PAO1 transposon mutant library and identified eight operons that \nare necessary for killing D. melanogaster. We show that by combining existing \nliterature with phenotyping a small number of strains, we identified both known \nand novel genes associated with insecticidal activity in D. melanogaster, using \na rapid, scalable screening framework. More broadly, these findings illustrate a \ndiscovery pipeline for bacterial virulence mechanisms, accelerating the \ndiscovery of insect pest biocontrol mechanisms.IMPORTANCEBacteria with \ninsecticidal properties offer a promising alternative to chemical pesticides, \nbut identifying effective strains and their underlying mechanisms remains a \nchallenge. Here, we used Pseudomonas-D. melanogaster as a model to develop a \npredictive framework for determining which known bacterial genes with \ninsecticidal activity are effective in a new host. By integrating comparative \ngenomics, statistical modeling, and experimental validation, we identified \ninsecticidal genes that are effective in D. melanogaster and highlighted new \ncandidates for future study, demonstrating the utility of our integrative \nmodeling approach. Our findings show that genetic predictors of virulence vary \nacross Pseudomonas phylogenetic groups, highlighting the potential for targeted \nbiocontrol strategies. We also demonstrate that disrupting specific pathways \nsignificantly reduces insecticidal activity, confirming their role in bacterial \nvirulence. As Pseudomonas strains are found in diverse environments, this \napproach may be broadly applicable for predicting insecticidal efficacy in other \nbacterial genera. By improving our ability to identify and engineer microbial \nbiocontrol agents, this work advances sustainable pest management strategies and \nprovides new tools for reducing reliance on conventional pesticides.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/spectrum.03108-25\nPMID: 41294238'}]},

Here, a carbapenem-resistant Comamonas aquatica \nisolate SCLZS63 was recovered from hospital sewage. Whole-genome sequencing \nshowed that SCLZS63 has a 4,048,791-bp circular chromosome and three plasmids. \nThe carbapenemase gene blaAFM-1 is located on the 143,067-bp untypable plasmid \np1_SCLZS63, which is a novel type of plasmid with two multidrug-resistant (MDR) \nregions. Notably, a novel class A serine β-lactamase gene, blaCAE-1, coexists \nwith blaAFM-1 in the mosaic MDR2 region. Cloning assay showed that CAE-1 confers \nresistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone, \nand elevates the MIC of ampicillin-sulbactam two-fold in Escherichia coli DH5α, \nsuggesting that CAE-1 functions as a broad-spectrum β-lactamase. Amino acid \nsequences analysis suggested that blaCAE-1 may originate from Comamonadaceae. \nThe blaAFM-1 in p1_SCLZS63 is located in a conserved structure of \nISCR29-ΔgroL-blaAFM-1-ble-ΔtrpF-ΔISCR27-msrB-msrA-yfcG-corA. Comprehensive \nanalysis of the blaAFM-bearing sequences revealed important roles of ISCR29 and \nΔISCR27 in the mobilization and truncation of the core module of blaAFM alleles, \nrespectively. The diverse passenger contents of class 1 integrons flanking the \nblaAFM core module make the complexity of genetic contexts for blaAFM. In \nconclusion, this study reveals that Comamonas may act as an important reservoir \nfor antibiotics-resistance genes and plasmids in the environment.

The bioremoval rates by ES38G, ES43G, ES45G, ES50G, and ES54G were \nsignificantly influenced by metal concentration, contact time, pH, temperature, \nand bacterial strains.

This \ncross-sectional study aimed to identify various cefotaxime-resistant and \nβ-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales and characterize their antimicrobial \nresistance profiles.\nMETHODS: Pooled cloacal and meat samples collected from market-ready broiler \nchickens in Kitwe and Ndola districts of Zambia were screened for \ncefotaxime-resistant Enterobacterales. The samples were inoculated on MacConkey \nagar supplemented with 1\u2005mg/L cefotaxime. The cefotaxime-resistant isolates were \nfurther subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Further, the isolated \ncefotaxime-resistant Enterobacterales were analysed for bla CTX-M, bla TEM, bla \nOXA-1-like and bla SHV genes using PCR and Sanger sequencing.\nRESULTS: From a total of 114 pooled samples, 81 (71.1%) cefotaxime-resistant \nGram-negative strains were isolated. These were dominated by Escherichia coli \n(77.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.2%), Pseudomonas spp. (6.2%), \nAcinetobacter baumannii (4.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%), Enterobacter spp. \n(1.2%) and Comamonas aquatica (1.2%). Furthermore, 64.2% of the 81 isolates \nexhibited multidrug resistance with high resistance (>64%) to ampicillin, \nco-trimoxazole and tetracycline. The results also showed that 66.7% of the \nisolates harboured at least one of the four tested bla genes (bla CTX-M, bla \nTEM, bla OXA-1-like and bla SHV), with the commonest being bla CTX-M (58%) and \nbla TEM (45.7%).\nCONCLUSIONS: The study revealed a high prevalence of cefotaxime-resistant \nEnterobacterales and multidrug resistance involving medically important \nantibiotics. Four bla genes (bla CTX-M, bla TEM, bla OXA-1-like and bla SHV) \nwere identified. Our results highlight the need to strengthen antimicrobial \nstewardship programmes and optimize antimicrobial use in poultry farming.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

Enhanced \nbiomethane yields was detected in the bioaugmented digesters, while the highest \nproduction was observed as 188 mLN CH4 gVS-1 in digesters operated at 37\xa0°C. \nMoreover, methane yield showed a significant improvement in the samples at 37\xa0°C \nranging from 110% to 141% compared to the control, demonstrating the efficiency \nof the enriched lignin-degrading microbial community. Temperature and substrate \nwere identified as key factors influencing microbial community dynamics. The \nobservation that microbial communities tended to revert to the initial state \nafter lignin depletion, indicating the stability of the overall microbiota \ncomposition in the digesters, is a promising finding for large-scale studies. \nNoteworthy candidates for lignin degradation, including Sporosarcina \npsychrophila, Comamonas aquatica, Shewanella baltica, Pseudomonas sp. C27, and \nBrevefilum fermentans were identified in the bioaugmented samples. PICRUSt2 \npredictions suggest that the pathway and specific proteins involved in anaerobic \nlignin degradation might share similarities with those engaged in the \ndegradation of aromatic compounds.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a carbapenem-resistant Comamonas aquatica \nisolate SCLZS63 was recovered from hospital sewage. Whole-genome sequencing \nshowed that SCLZS63 has a 4,048,791-bp circular chromosome and three plasmids. \nThe carbapenemase gene blaAFM-1 is located on the 143,067-bp untypable plasmid \np1_SCLZS63, which is a novel type of plasmid with two multidrug-resistant (MDR) \nregions. Notably, a novel class A serine β-lactamase gene, blaCAE-1, coexists \nwith blaAFM-1 in the mosaic MDR2 region. Cloning assay showed that CAE-1 confers \nresistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefuroxime, and ceftriaxone, \nand elevates the MIC of ampicillin-sulbactam two-fold in Escherichia coli DH5α, \nsuggesting that CAE-1 functions as a broad-spectrum β-lactamase. Amino acid \nsequences analysis suggested that blaCAE-1 may originate from Comamonadaceae. \nThe blaAFM-1 in p1_SCLZS63 is located in a conserved structure of \nISCR29-ΔgroL-blaAFM-1-ble-ΔtrpF-ΔISCR27-msrB-msrA-yfcG-corA. Comprehensive \nanalysis of the blaAFM-bearing sequences revealed important roles of ISCR29 and \nΔISCR27 in the mobilization and truncation of the core module of blaAFM alleles, \nrespectively. The diverse passenger contents of class 1 integrons flanking the \nblaAFM core module make the complexity of genetic contexts for blaAFM. In \nconclusion, this study reveals that Comamonas may act as an important reservoir \nfor antibiotics-resistance genes and plasmids in the environment. Continuous \nmonitoring for the environmental emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria \nis needed to control the spread of antimicrobial resistance.\n\n© 2023.

Three \ndrugs exhibited the strongest binding affinities, outperforming the control \ndrug, Cidofovir diphosphate, and forming stable interactions with key active \nsite residues. Among them, Paromomycin emerged as the most favourable drug, \ndemonstrating stable, persistent, and adaptable interactions in molecular \ndynamics simulation. In parallel, we developed a novel automated \npeptide-generating AI pipeline that integrates active-site residues with \nknowledge-guided amino acid selection to generate and evaluate synthetic \npeptides. Cysteine-Phenylalanine-Cysteine (CFC), together with a panel of \ncandidates, emerged through rational balancing of physicochemical properties and \ndrug-likeness for accelerated therapeutic discovery. Synthetic peptides were \nevaluated to further understand the binding efficacies with DNA polymerase. CFC \npeptide demonstrated strong binding affinity (-8.08\xa0kcal/mol) through stable \ninteractions with key catalytic residues ASP549, ARG634 and LYS661, while MMGBSA \nanalysis confirmed favourable binding energy (-33.02\xa0kcal/mol). Consistent \nresults in MD simulations indicate functional binding without destabilisation. \nAlthough ADMET predictions for CFC revealed limitations in permeability and oral \nbioavailability, its favourable binding profile and reduced predicted toxicity \nsupport its potential as a novel antiviral lead.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Mpox pneumonia is a prominent severe phenotype, but systematic reports \nfrom China are scarce.\nMETHODS: This multicenter retrospective study analyzed 41 HIV-infected patients \nwith Mpox (June 2022-February 2025), divided into a pneumonia group (n\u202f=\u202f21) and \na control group (n\u202f=\u202f20). Clinical, laboratory, and thin-section chest computed \ntomography (CT) findings, multisystem involvement, outcomes, and the roles of \nimmune status and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence were compared.\nRESULTS: All patients were men who have sex with men. Mpox pneumonia occurred \nalmost exclusively in patients with CD4+ T-cell counts <200/μL. Thin-section CT \nrevealed multiple, randomly distributed, well-demarcated, non-enhancing nodules \n(2-36\u202fmm), consistent with hematogenous necrotizing lesions. All pneumonia cases \nhad ≥2 organ systems involved (e.g., proctitis, necrotic skin lesions, \nintestinal obstruction, sepsis). Compared with controls, pneumonia patients \nshowed more frequent inflammation and organ injury markers (elevated C-reactive \nprotein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, creatinine, and anemia). The case fatality rate \nwas 38.1% (8/21) in the pneumonia group versus 0% in controls. Patients with \nconsistent ART recovered, whereas all deaths occurred in those untreated or with \nirregular ART adherence.\nCONCLUSION: Mpox pneumonia in HIV-infected individuals primarily affects those \nwith advanced immunosuppression, presenting with disseminated necrotizing \npulmonary nodules, multisystem involvement, and high mortality. Consistent ART \nmarkedly improves prognosis, highlighting the need for early identification of \nhigh-risk patients and integrated management-including sustained ART and \ntargeted Mpox treatment-to reduce severe outcomes.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Wang, Zhou, Yuan, Wang, Yin, Zhao, Shi, Chen and Li.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1705001\nPMCID: PMC12675438\nPMID: 41356465\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."},

Only sporadic cases \ncaused by the emerging MPXV clade Ib have been reported in Europe to date.\nAIM: To assess the potential for environmental contamination and indirect or \nairborne transmission, we conducted longitudinal environmental sampling during \nthe hospitalization of the first German imported mpox clade Ib case in an \nairborne infection isolation room.\nMETHODS: Over a period of eight days, six standardized sampling series were \ncarried out in the anteroom, patient's room, and bathroom at least six hours \nafter cleaning. Swab samples from high- and low-touch areas and air samples \n(Coriolis μ impinger) were taken. Additionally, the exhaust HEPA filters and \nmobile air purifier filters were analysed. MPXV contamination was determined by \nPCR and subsequently virus culture was performed.\nFINDINGS: Surface and air contamination with MPXV DNA was detected in high- and \nlow-touch areas, as well as near and far from the patient (PCR-positivity: 92 of \n100 surface samples and 11 of 12 air samples). Moreover, the analysed \nair-filters and adhered dust tested positive for MPXV DNA. However, \nreplication-competent virus was identified only on the toilet seat surface on \nthe first sampling day.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data show a high degree of MPXV DNA contamination in the \npatient's environment and suggest potentially infectious fomites. While the \nrelation between widespread DNA contamination and actual transmission risk \nremains difficult to assess and needs further investigation, our findings \nunderscore the importance of environmental cleaning and disinfection.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

The traditional plaque purification process to screen out a \nvaccine strain with genetically consistent stability from a mixed pool of viral \nclones generally requires laborsome work. We utilized live-cell imaging \ntechnique enabling us to isolate monoclonal vaccine strains to simplify and \nimprove the efficiency of this process. Here, we genetically engineered the \nvaccinia virus TianTan (VTT) using CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate recombinant \nVTT viruses (VTT-WS01-EGFP) that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein \n(EGFP). Initially, we performed 9 rounds of plaque purification using \ntraditional plaque assay, yielding 50 candidate clones. The Incucyte Live-Cell \nImaging and Analysis system was subsequently performed to conduct a rigorous, \nhigh-resolution screening of these candidates in a more automated, sensitive and \nhigh-throughput way. Through this screening process, we ultimately obtained 31 \npure viral clones that were free of parental strain contamination, followed by \nthe analysis of plaque formation, fluorescent plaque size, and plaque \nmorphology, and 11 candidate clones were selected for immunological evaluation. \nFurthermore, we found that clone 49 induced a relatively high titer of anti-VTT \nneutralizing antibodies and elicited the production of cross-reactive IgG \nagainst monkeypox virus antigens, thereby validating its potential as a \ncandidate strain as a monkeypox virus vaccine. Taken together, our data \ndemonstrates that live-cell imaging technique significantly accelerates the \nscreening process for the isolation of monoclonal viral clones as recombinant \nviral vaccines, and holds considerable potential in attenuated strain selection \nas well as investigations into biological characteristics of viruses, including \nviral replication.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Given the high sensitivity of bioinformatics data, \nparticularly gene sequences, plaintext transmission and processing in cloud \nenvironments pose risks of privacy leakage. To address this, this study \ninnovatively proposes an analytical method combining Mamba neural network-based \ngene sequence prediction with homomorphic encryption, enabling secure data \ntransmission while employing deep learning for sequence prediction. Using the \nmonkeypox virus experimental ID SRX17751190 and sequencing ID SRR21755835 as \nexamples, the study first decomposes the original gene sequence using VMD modal \ndecomposition, then predicts the gene sequence from the decomposed components \nusing the Mamba neural network, and finally performs homomorphic encryption and \nspatial similarity analysis on the predicted data in a cloud computing \nenvironment. Experimental results demonstrate that the average MAE, MSE, RMSE, \nMAPE, and MSPE for the top ten predicted gene sequences are 0.0140, 0.0003, \n0.0190, 0.6527, and 789.52959, respectively, with an average CKKS homomorphic \nencryption computation error of 0.582492456.

Molecular analyses \nidentified 157 SNPs, most of which were APOBEC3-like mutations, suggesting \nhost-driven viral editing. A higher number of SNPs and APOBEC3-related mutations \nin 2024 compared to 2023 indicates ongoing viral evolution.

The sequence clusters within \nthe recently documented sh2024a outbreak in Kinshasa and displays \nAPOBEC3-associated mutational signatures consistent with sustained \nhuman-to-human transmission.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case highlights changes in the global epidemiology of \nmonkeypox virus clade Ia and underscores the need for enhanced surveillance and \ncoordinated international public health responses. Early detection and \nmonitoring by whole-genome sequencing are essential for mitigating the risks \nposed by possible expansion beyond traditionally endemic areas.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Mpox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox \nvirus (MPXV). MPXV clade Ia is one type of MPXV. Until recently, MPXV clade Ia \ninfections mainly occurred in parts of central Africa and human infections were \nmainly transmitted from animals. In February 2025, a case of MPXV clade Ia \ninfection was identified in a person returning to Ireland from the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo. Here, we describe the clinical features and laboratory \nresults of the case. This case report draws attention to recent changes in the \ntransmission of this virus with spread to regions not previously affected. This \nhighlights issues around the importance of monitoring MPXV clade Ia and other \nviruses, including through laboratory-based surveillance.\n\n© 2025.

The study follows participants every 6 \nmonths and collects social, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. A total \nof 131 respiratory samples, collected from March 2022 to February 2023 from \nparticipants in South Rift Valley Province, Kenya, who had symptoms of \nrespiratory illness or a positive COVID-19 test, were analyzed using a pan-viral \nhybridization metagenomic next-generation sequencing approach. Libraries were \nsequenced on the Illumina Next-generation Sequencing System NovaSeq 6000. Sample \ndata were run through several pathogen discovery pipelines.\nRESULTS: Full genome and partial genome sequences were assembled for several \nrespiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2, human coronavirus HKU1, human \nadenovirus 62, human metapneumovirus, human mastadenovirus B (coinfection with \nSARS-CoV-2), human mastadenovirus C (coinfection with SARS-CoV-2), and human \nparechovirus 3 (coinfection with adenovirus 62). The results showed that \nSARS-CoV-2 lineages correspond with lineages circulating during March 2022 to \nFebruary 2023 and revealed additional viral respiratory pathogens and viruses \nknown to be associated with HIV.\nCONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that continued genomic \nsurveillance efforts are needed for data-driven decisions on force health \nprotection, prevention of emerging respiratory infections, and mitigation of \nimpacts on military readiness caused by infectious diseases.\n\nPublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military \nSurgeons of the United States 2025.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/milmed/usaf180\nPMCID: PMC12448724\nPMID: 40984062 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: None declared."},

Continuous molecular \nsurveillance is essential to understand their epidemiology, genetic diversity, \nand seasonal dynamics. In 2024, a surveillance study was conducted in Bangkok, \nThailand, involving 8,130 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from ARI patients. HAdV \nwas detected in 5.3% (429/8,130) of ARI cases, with peak weekly positivity \nreaching 17.7% during weeks 10-12 (March). These HAdV-positive samples were \nsubsequently genotyped through partial hexon gene sequencing and phylogenetic \nanalysis using the maximum likelihood method. HAdV-B3 was the predominant \ngenotype (70.7%), followed by HAdV-C2 (11.6%) and HAdV-C1 (10.4%). Genotype \ndiversity increased toward the end of the year, with the emergence of HAdV-B7, \nC5, and C6. The majority of cases occurred in children aged 0-9 years, with \nHAdV-B3 dominating across all pediatric groups. Phylogenetic analysis revealed \nclose genetic relationships between Thai strains and reference strains from \nChina, Japan, the USA, and Europe, indicating both local circulation and \ninternational linkages. Despite the detection of HAdV-B7, no severe outcomes \nwere reported in this cohort. This study also reports potential relevant sites \nunder episodic positive selection in the hexon gene, suggesting adaptive \nevolution at specific codon positions. This study provides updated insight into \nthe molecular epidemiology of HAdV in Thailand. The findings highlight seasonal \nand age-specific patterns in genotype distribution and underscore the importance \nof continued genomic surveillance to detect emerging variants and guide public \nhealth responses.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 Puenpa et al.

Across all severity levels, \nthe SA-LFK consistently demonstrated higher sensitivity than the NSA-LFK, \nincluding in mild-to-moderate cases (77.8% vs. 59.3%, p = 0.004), supporting its \nsuperior diagnostic performance.

Continuous molecular \nsurveillance is essential to understand their epidemiology, genetic diversity, \nand seasonal dynamics. In 2024, a surveillance study was conducted in Bangkok, \nThailand, involving 8,130 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from ARI patients. HAdV \nwas detected in 5.3% (429/8,130) of ARI cases, with peak weekly positivity \nreaching 17.7% during weeks 10-12 (March). These HAdV-positive samples were \nsubsequently genotyped through partial hexon gene sequencing and phylogenetic \nanalysis using the maximum likelihood method. HAdV-B3 was the predominant \ngenotype (70.7%), followed by HAdV-C2 (11.6%) and HAdV-C1 (10.4%). Genotype \ndiversity increased toward the end of the year, with the emergence of HAdV-B7, \nC5, and C6. The majority of cases occurred in children aged 0-9 years, with \nHAdV-B3 dominating across all pediatric groups. Phylogenetic analysis revealed \nclose genetic relationships between Thai strains and reference strains from \nChina, Japan, the USA, and Europe, indicating both local circulation and \ninternational linkages. Despite the detection of HAdV-B7, no severe outcomes \nwere reported in this cohort. This study also reports potential relevant sites \nunder episodic positive selection in the hexon gene, suggesting adaptive \nevolution at specific codon positions. This study provides updated insight into \nthe molecular epidemiology of HAdV in Thailand. The findings highlight seasonal \nand age-specific patterns in genotype distribution and underscore the importance \nof continued genomic surveillance to detect emerging variants and guide public \nhealth responses.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 Puenpa et al.

The assay was designed with species-specific primers \ntargeting 5 key genes: 16S rRNA, RD9, ITS (internal transcribed spacer) \nregion-MAC, ITS region-MCAG, and mkan-rs12360. Its feasibility and lower limit \nof detection (LOD) were validated using 6 standard mycobacterial strains; \ndiagnostic accuracy was further assessed using 68 clinical isolates and 130 \nclinical sputum samples, with whole-genome sequencing and targeted \nnext-generation sequencing serving as the respective gold standards for isolates \nand sputum specimens. The multiplex PCR assay exhibited high specificity for the \ntarget genes and primers: for standard strains, the LOD ranged from 0.7 to 5.0 \npg/μL; for artificially simulated sputum samples, the LOD was 5.6 to 26.7 pg/μL \nfor single infections and 7.1 to 43.9 pg/μL for mixed infections. Against \nwhole-genome sequencing, the assay achieved 100% detection rate and accuracy for \nclinical isolates. When compared with targeted next-generation sequencing for \nclinical sputum samples, the detection rates for single infections of MTB, MAC, \nMCAG, and M kansasii were 26%, 75%, 56.5%, and 50%, respectively, with an \noverall detection rate of 51.2% and 100% diagnostic accuracy. This multiplex PCR \nassay enables rapid and accurate identification of major pathogenic mycobacteria \nin clinical isolates; however, its sensitivity limitations - evidenced by \nrelatively low detection rates in clinical sputum samples, especially mixed \ninfections - highlight the need for further optimization with more sensitive \nprobe-based technologies to enhance clinical applicability.\n\nCopyright © 2025 the Author(s).

The assay was designed with species-specific primers \ntargeting 5 key genes: 16S rRNA, RD9, ITS (internal transcribed spacer) \nregion-MAC, ITS region-MCAG, and mkan-rs12360. Its feasibility and lower limit \nof detection (LOD) were validated using 6 standard mycobacterial strains; \ndiagnostic accuracy was further assessed using 68 clinical isolates and 130 \nclinical sputum samples, with whole-genome sequencing and targeted \nnext-generation sequencing serving as the respective gold standards for isolates \nand sputum specimens. The multiplex PCR assay exhibited high specificity for the \ntarget genes and primers: for standard strains, the LOD ranged from 0.7 to 5.0 \npg/μL; for artificially simulated sputum samples, the LOD was 5.6 to 26.7 pg/μL \nfor single infections and 7.1 to 43.9 pg/μL for mixed infections. Against \nwhole-genome sequencing, the assay achieved 100% detection rate and accuracy for \nclinical isolates. When compared with targeted next-generation sequencing for \nclinical sputum samples, the detection rates for single infections of MTB, MAC, \nMCAG, and M kansasii were 26%, 75%, 56.5%, and 50%, respectively, with an \noverall detection rate of 51.2% and 100% diagnostic accuracy. This multiplex PCR \nassay enables rapid and accurate identification of major pathogenic mycobacteria \nin clinical isolates; however, its sensitivity limitations - evidenced by \nrelatively low detection rates in clinical sputum samples, especially mixed \ninfections - highlight the need for further optimization with more sensitive \nprobe-based technologies to enhance clinical applicability.\n\nCopyright © 2025 the Author(s).

Marine sponges \nare a rich source of promising bioactive compounds. Due to their sessile nature \nand filter-feeding lifestyle, sponges are prone to attack by competitors, \npredators, and pathogens. To combat these threats, they produce a diverse array \nof bioactive compounds. Notably, the microbial communities residing within the \nsponges make many of these beneficial compounds. Twenty-one bacterial isolates \nfrom various marine sponges from the Indian coast were selected for this study. \nThe bacterial isolates were fermented to obtain crude extracts, which were then \nscreened against critical bacterial pathogens. Based on the MIC (minimum \ninhibitory concentration) results, two isolates, Bacillus velezensis NIO_002 and \nStutzerimonas stutzeri NIO_003 showing good activity, were characterized by \nmorphological, biochemical, and molecular methods. Genome mining predicted \nmultiple antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters, most of which showed a high \ndegree of similarity to known gene clusters, and some with low or no similarity \nwhich may be indicative of novel gene clusters. LC-MS (liquid \nchromatography-mass spectrometry) data revealed the putative presence of certain \nantibacterial compounds previously reported in the literature. To our knowledge, \nthis is the first study to report the antimicrobial activity of marine \nsponge-associated Bacillus velezensis and Stutzerimonas stutzeri strains \ncharacterized by whole genome sequencing, thereby indicating the novelty of our \nstrains.

In this study, a novel \nlytic S. stutzeri phage, named vB_PstM_ZRG1, was isolated from the seawater in \nthe East China Sea (29°09'N, 123°39'E). vB_PstM_ZRG1 was stable at temperatures \nranging from -20°C to 65°C and across a wide range of pH values from 3 to 10. \nThe genome of vB_PstM_ZRG1 was determined to be a double-stranded DNA with a \ngenome size of 52,767 bp, containing 78 putative open reading frames (ORFs). \nThree auxiliary metabolic genes encoded by phage vB_PstM_ZRG1 were predicted, \nincluding Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain, \nproline-alanine-alanine-arginine (PAAR) protein and SGNH (Ser-Gly-Asn-His) \nfamily hydrolase, especially TIR domain is not common in isolated phages. \nPhylogenic and network analysis showed that vB_PstM_ZRG1 has low similarity to \nother phage genomes in the GenBank and IMG/VR database, and might represent a \nnovel viral genus, named Elithevirus. Additionally, the distribution map results \nindicated that vB_PstM_ZRG1 could infect both extreme colds- and warm-type hosts \nin the marine environment. In summary, our finding provided basic information \nfor further research on the relationship between S. stutzeri and their phages, \nand expanded our understanding of genomic characteristics, phylogenetic \ndiversity and distribution of Elithevirus.\n\nCopyright © 2023 The Authors.

Biodegradation of plastic films \nenlighten the microbial activity towards plastic treatment without harming the \necosystem. Advancement towards biodegradation with aid of nanoparticles as \ndegradation enhancer provides a synergistic approach to mitigate the plastic \npollution. In this study, plastic degrading microorganisms were isolated from \nagriculture soil and metal nanoparticles such as Zinc oxide (ZnO) and \nZinc-Magnesium oxide (ZnO-MgO) nanoparticles were synthesized using \nCo-precipitation method. Thus prepared inorganic metal nanoparticles were \nsubsequently added to enhance the microbial degradation action. The synthesised \nnanoparticles appeared as hexagonal nanoflakes with a size range of 32.8 and \n35\xa0nm respectively. The isolated strain from the soil Stutzerimonas stutzeri, a \ngram negative bacterium was identified using 16S rRNA sequencing technique. The \nplastic films treated with isolated strain, showed 65% of degradation efficiency \nrate in the presence of synthesised nanoparticles as enhancers. SEM analysis \nconfirmed the bacterial adhesion and revealed significant structural damage such \nas cracks, pits, holes and erosion in plastic film. FT-IR analysis revealed the \npresence of functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O) and (-CH) stretching at \n1076\xa0cm-1 and 719\xa0cm-1 as a indication of polymer degradation. Further, simpler \nmetabolic by-products formation such as fatty acids and succinic acid were \nanalyzed using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). Further, metabolic \nbyproducts were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and \ntheir toxicity was assessed using the Allium cepa as an invitro plant model. The \nabsence of negative effects on mitotic cell division suggested that no toxic \ncompounds were released during the microbial degradation process. This study \nreveals about an improved method of nanoparticles assisted biodegradation which \nmay pave a better pathway for sustainable solution in plastic waste management.\n\n© 2025.

In \nthis study, chemotactic strain named as Stutzerimonas stutzeri M3 and salicylic \nacid were employed for enhancing biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbon. The \naddition of salicylic acid significantly enhanced the activities of alkane \nhydroxylase and catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, as well as the biodegradation rate of \npetroleum hydrocarbons. Moreover, the inputs of salicylic acid reshaped \nmicrobial community, and obviously affected their cooperative metabolic process \nby increasing relative abundance of petroleum-degrading bacteria, such as \nStutzerimonas, Pontibacillus, Halobacillus and Virgibacillus. Metagenomic \nanalysis furtherly confirmed that overall metabolic pathways of microbial \ncommunities and expression of functional genes associated with petroleum \ndegradation (e.g., fad, cat and nah) were enhanced. Furthermore, chemotactic \ngene expression in strain M3 was significantly increased, thereby facilitating \npetroleum hydrocarbons degradation.

This study \nfocused on isolating and characterizing PGPR strains native to the cocoa \nrhizosphere in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh and assessing their efficacy \nagainst Phytophthora palmivora, the causal agent of cocoa pod rot. A total of 50 \nbacterial isolates were initially screened based on hydrolytic enzyme \nproduction, siderophore activity, phosphate solubilization, and antagonistic \npotential. Six promising isolates NEG27, NWG12, NSK3, NEG14, NEG16, and \nNEG3-showed strong antifungal activity and were identified through 16\xa0S rRNA \nsequencing as Pseudomonas fluorescens (NEG27, NEG3), Stutzerimonas stutzeri \n(NWG12), and Pseudomonas otitidis (NEG14, NEG16, NSK3). In vitro antagonism \nassays demonstrated that NEG27 inhibited P. palmivora mycelial growth by 82.26%, \nfollowed by NWG12 (77.41%) and NEG14 (76.30%), with microscopy revealing severe \nhyphal disintegration and malformed zoospores. PGPR seed treatment significantly \nenhanced cocoa germination rates (35.71% increase over control), seedling vigour \nindex (by 441.84%), and root-shoot biomass (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Field trials conducted \nover two cropping seasons (2022-23 and 2023-24) revealed that combined foliar \napplication of NEG27, NWG12, and NSK3 at 1.5% significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) reduced \npod rot disease severity compared to untreated controls, while also improving \nyield-related traits and the benefit-to-cost (B: C) ratio.

Based on the highest emulsification activity, the \nmost effective bacterial isolates were selected and subjected to biosurfactant \nisolation. Further, the characterization using TLC, FTIR, and LC-MS were \nperformed. The bacteria and genes that produced biosurfactants have been \nidentified via 16S rRNA sequence analysis.\nRESULTS: The isolate MW 15 was selected for structural identification given its \nmaximum oil displacement activity, effective surface tension reduction \npotential, and favourable emulsification index (E24) of 51.3 %. The purified \nbiosurfactant from MW 15 exhibited structural similarities to rhamnolipid \nbiosurfactant. The biosurfactant-produced strain was identified as Stutzerimonas \nstutzeri by 16Sr RNA sequencing and the nucleotide sequences were deposited in \nGenBank with accession number PP779775. Mega 11 software was employed for \nconstructing the phylogenetic tree, and it was confirmed that a gene which \nproduces rhamnolipid (rhlA) was present.\nCONCLUSION: Totally eight bacteria were isolated from petroleum \nhydrocarbon-contaminated marine harbour water. The isolate Stutzerimonas \nstutzeri showed better production of biosurfactants and biodegradation ability \nwhen compared with other biosurfactant-produced isolates.

Cases were \ndefined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)\xa0<\xa01000/µL. Controls without \nneutropenia were matched by age (+/-1 year), transplanted organ, and duration of \nVGCV prophylaxis. We used a published population pharmacokinetic model to inform \npredictions of GCV concentrations using Pmetrics, accounting for each subject's \ntime-dependent variables (age, weight, creatinine clearance). We then calculated \n24-h, 7-day, and cumulative area under the curve (AUC) in each subject and used \nconditional logistic regression to compare GCV exposures among cases and \ncontrols.\nRESULTS: Among 164 pSOT recipients prescribed VGCV, we identified 35 \ncase-control matches. There were no statistically significant differences in the \n24-h (odds ratio [OR] 0.990, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.964-1.018), 7-day \n(OR 1.000, 95% CI 0.996-1.004), or cumulative AUCs (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.9996-1.00) \namong all cases and controls. AUC metrics by SOT type also showed no \nstatistically significant differences.\nCONCLUSIONS: Predicted GCV exposures were similar among pSOT recipients with and \nwithout neutropenia, suggesting that differences in dosing and pharmacokinetics \ncovariates did not drive toxicity in our population. Measurement of GCV \nconcentrations may discern whether toxicity relates to exposures/concentrations \nor intrinsic factors (i.e., genetics) in the pSOT population.\n\n© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/tid.70146\nPMID: 41364029"},

It has a large genome, infects the majority of \npopulations, and typically causes asymptomatic infections in healthy \nindividuals. After the initial infection with established lifelong latency, HCMV \ncan reactivate and cause disorders including neuropathies. Besides the \ninfections typically in immunocompromised patients, HCMV may also trigger \nautoimmunity leading to tissue injury and associated pathologies. \nHCMV-associated neuropathies are a pathogenically heterogeneous group of \nperipheral nervous system (PNS) disorders that include direct HCMV infection of \nthe nerve(s), as well as non-infectious associated neuropathies such as axonal \nor degenerative, vasculitic/ischemic or necrotizing, inflammatory demyelinating, \nand immune-mediated forms. Congenital HCMV-associated neuropathies primarily \ninvolve the cochlear/auditory and optic nerves with somewhat distinct pathogenic \nmechanisms compared with their postnatal counterparts, largely due to the \nimmaturity of the fetal immune system. This article reviews the pathophysiology \nof PNS involvement in HCMV infection, followed by congenital HCMV-associated \nneuropathies with a case demonstration, and various postnatal HCMV-associated \nneuropathies, including a detailed review of HCMV-associated optic neuropathies, \nfrom pathogenic mechanisms to clinical and therapeutic implications. As the PNS \nhas a few immune protective mechanisms against pathogens, direct HCMV infection \nof nerves is rare and occurs only in immunocompromised patients; most \nHCMV-associated neuropathies are secondary with multiple pathogenic mechanisms \nincluding varying degrees of autoimmunity. While the clinical manifestations of \nHCMV-associated neuropathies are variable, their treatment is typically \nempirical and case-based, focusing on antiviral therapy often combined with \nimmunomodulatory approaches. Prompt and appropriate management can improve \noutcomes of HCMV-associated neuropathies.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

This study \naimed to detect CMV seroprevalence and reactivation among patients who had been \nexposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).\nMETHODOLOGY: The study was conducted between 2017 and 2022 and included adult \nparticipants who were serologically diagnosed with hepatitis B (63 participants) \nor hepatitis C (69 participants), as well as 132 control respondents. CMV IgG \nand IgM levels were measured for all 264 respondents; CMV IgG avidity was \nfurther determined for those who tested positive for CMV IgG and IgM.\nRESULTS: The total CMV IgG seroprevalence observed in the study was 95.4%, with \n98.5% in HCV-positive, 96.8% in HBV-positive, and 95.2% in control respondents; \nand with a slightly higher prevalence in women (97.1%) compared to men (94.9%). \nThe overall CMV reactivation rate among anti-HCV positive respondents was 2.9%. \nAlthough no significant difference was found in the reactivation rate of CMV \nbetween anti-HCV positive and negative respondents, the reactivation rate of CMV \nwithin the subgroup of HCV RNA positive individuals was higher at 4.4%. In \ncontrast, no CMV reactivation was observed in the respondents without detectable \nHCV RNA. No CMV reactivation was detected in the HBV group.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study did not confirm a higher reactivation rate of CMV in \nHBV- or HCV-positive respondents compared to the control cases.

To elucidate the function of the gM/gN complex in \nsecondary envelopment, we employed a combination of viral mutants, siRNA \nknockdown, and ultrastructural analyses. Ultrastructural examination of a mutant \nvirus with a cysteine-to-serine mutation in the cytoplasmic tail of gN \n(TB-gN-C123S) showed a defect in the initiation of secondary envelopment as most \ncapsids in TB-gN-C123S-infected cells were either not in contact with \ncytoplasmic membranes or, when near membranes, lacked signs of budding. The \ndefect in secondary envelopment was associated with an accumulation of partially \ntegumented capsids in the peripheral region of the cytoplasmic viral assembly \ncompartment (cVAC). Additionally, large protein aggregates were observed within \nand near the cVAC, often associated with non-enveloped capsids. A comparable \nultrastructural phenotype was observed in wild-type virus-infected cells treated \nwith siRNA against gM. Further evidence underscoring the role of the gM/gN \nglycoprotein complex in viral morphogenesis was obtained by investigating gM- \nand gN-null mutants, which displayed the same altered capsid distribution \nobserved in TB-gN-C123S infections and after siRNA knockdown of gM. Finally, the \ninhibition of palmitoylation in wild-type virus-infected cells resulted in \nanalogous defects, including an accumulation of partially tegumented capsids in \nthe periphery of the cVAC and protein aggregates associated with capsids. In \nsummary, our findings indicate a crucial role for the gM/gN complex in \ninitiating secondary envelopment and highlight the involvement of palmitoylation \nin this process.IMPORTANCEHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread \nherpesvirus that can cause severe illness in newborns and immunocompromised \nindividuals. Like other herpesviruses, HCMV assembles its infectious particles \nthrough a complex process where the virus acquires its envelope through \nsecondary envelopment. In this study, we investigated the role of glycoprotein M \n(gM) and glycoprotein N (gN), which form a conserved complex across \nherpesviruses. Using genetic mutants, RNA interference, and electron microscopy, \nwe found that the gM/gN complex is crucial for initiating secondary envelopment. \nDisruption of gM or gN function, or palmitoylation inhibition, prevents capsids \nfrom budding into membranes, resulting in partially tegumented capsids that \naccumulated at the periphery of the cytoplasmic viral assembly compartment \n(cVAC). Our findings highlight the important role of the gM/gN complex and \npalmitoylation in HCMV assembly and suggest that the assembly occurs in a \nspatially organized manner within the cVAC, providing new insights into how \nherpesviruses produce infectious particles.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/jvi.01567-25\nPMID: 41358725'}],

Most \nstudies have focused on peripheral NK (pNK) cells, which may not accurately \nreflect the uterine immune environment. This study aimed to investigate the \nreceptor repertoire of uterine NK (uNK) cells derived from menstrual blood in \nwomen with iRPL (n\u202f=\u202f20) and compare it to controls with uncomplicated \npregnancies (n\u202f=\u202f16). The uNK cell receptor analysis revealed a significant \nreduction in the expression intensities of 2B4 and NKp44 on several uNK cell \nclusters in women with iRPL. In addition, stratification by cytomegalovirus \n(CMV) seropositivity revealed that CMV-positive women had significantly higher \nNKp44 expression on uNK cells and frequencies of NKG2A+KIRs+LILRB1+NKG2C- uNK \ncells (10.3\u202f% vs. 4.2\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.025) compared to CMV-negative women. \nSurprisingly, this population was lowest in women with primary iRPL compared to \nsecondary iRPL and control subjects (2.6\u202f% vs. 8.6\u202f%, 12.8\u202f%, p\u202f=\u202f0.005). These \nfindings highlight differences in uNK cell receptor repertoire of women with \niRPL and indicate that live birth history and CMV seropositivity influence uNK \ncells.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

Although \nKorea has historically shown high CMV IgG seropositivity (>95%), declines have \nbeen reported recently. We assessed current CMV IgG seropositivity and analyzed \nprevailing trends in the Korean population.\nMETHODS: Residual samples from individuals undergoing regular health checkups \nwere analyzed. We assessed 1,978 samples (from 937 men and 1,041 women) where \nthe age group distribution was relatively balanced. CMV IgG levels were measured \nat two institutions using a commercial immunoassay (Alinity i CMV IgG Reagent \nKit, Abbott) following the manufacturer\'s instructions. Results were interpreted \nas "reactive" when the CMV IgG concentration was ≥ 6.0 arbitrary units (AU)/mL \nor "nonreactive" when the CMV IgG concentration was <6.0 AU/mL. Seropositivity \nwas compared by sex and across age groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59 yrs).\nRESULTS: The overall CMV IgG seropositivity was 89.9% (1,778/1,978) and was \nsignificantly higher in men (91.7%, 859/937) than in women (88.3%, 919/1,041) \n(difference: 3.4%; 95% confidence interval: 0.8%-6.0%; P =0.012, chi-square \ntest). No significant differences with regard to sex were found within each age \ngroup. Seropositivity increased with age, from 76.3% (347/455, 20-29 yrs) to \n99.8% (448/449, 50-59 yrs) (P for trend <0.001), consistently in both sexes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the most up-to-date estimate of CMV IgG \nseropositivity in the Korean adult population. Because of lower seropositivity \nin younger adults, continued monitoring and further education are essential for \nCMV control and prevention.\n\nDOI: 10.3343/alm.2025.0326\nPMID: 41287147'},

To identify \nwhether acute clinical P. falciparum malaria affects EBV T-cell immunity, we \ncharacterized T-cell activation status and cytokine secretion profiles using \nflow cytometry. We compared profiles in 10 Kenyan children with acute clinical \nP. falciparum malaria at baseline and matched 4-week recovery, and 10 healthy \ncommunity controls following antigenic stimulation with EBV- and \ncytomegalovirus-specific peptides.

The emergence of mutations within \nconserved genomic regions of HCMV genes targeted by antiviral therapies, \nsignificantly complicating the interpretation of resistance and treatment \ndecisions. Although the molecular characterization of such mutations and their \nclinical correlation are critical to guide appropriate therapeutic strategies, \nthe significance of many detected mutations and variants, even those in \nconserved regions, remain uncertain in terms of in vitro or in vivo drug \nresistance. In this study, we clinically evaluated 15 such novel mutations.\nMETHODS: Clinical specimens from immunocompromised and transplant patients with \nconfirmed HCMV DNAemia were sequenced for UL97, UL54, and UL56. The detected \nvariants were aligned with the HCMV Merlin reference genome and evaluated for \nnovelty and conservation. Patient records were retrospectively reviewed to \nassess antiviral regimens, virological responses, and clinical outcomes.\nRESULTS: In total, 13 patients (25%) exhibited novel UL97, UL54, and UL56 \nmutations. Four patients (30.77%) met the criteria for refractory HCMV DNAemia \nwith varying clinical responses. Some patients responded to first-line antiviral \nagents despite carrying resistance-associated variants.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of CMV among \nchildren and immunocompromised patients in the Nizhny Novgorod region (central \nRussia) and to perform a phylogenetic analysis of the identified strains.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA samples of CMV detected in frequently ill children \nand adult recipients of solid organs were studied. The genetic diversity of CMV \nwas assessed for two variable genes: UL55(gB) and UL73(gN), using NGS technology \non the Illumina platform. Phylogenetic trees were constructed in the MEGA X \nprogram, the reliability of the cluster topology on the trees was confirmed \nusing the rapid bootstrap method based on the generation of 500 pseudo-replicas.\nRESULTS: Circulation of 5 CMV genotypes by gene UL55(gB) and 5 genotypes by gene \nUL73(gN) was established in the territory of the Nizhny Novgorod region. While \ngenotypes gB1 and gB2 dominated both in children and in adults, genotype gB5 was \ndetected only in children. The spectrum of gN genotypes was more diverse: \ngenotypes gN4a and gN3b prevailed in children, and gN1 and gN4b genotypes were \npredominant in adults. The obtained results allowed us to establish the \nsimilarity of the landscape of CMV genotypes circulating in Russia (Nizhny \nNovgorod region), Brazil, China and the USA.\nCONCLUSION: The obtained data indicate the similarity of the landscape of CMV \ngenotypes circulating in Russia (Nizhny Novgorod region), Brazil, China and the \nUSA: in children, the predominant genotypes are gB1 (40.0%), gB2 (33.3%), gN4a \n(42.8%), and gN3b (28.6%), while in adults (recipients of solid organs) \ngenotypes gB1 (37.5%), gB2 (37.5%), gN1 (26.3%), and gN4b (26.3%) are prevailed.\n\nPublisher: Введение.

The \nspecific pathogen free (SPF) mice were employed to perform the study. Genomic \nsequencing showed that the intrinsic microbes in the heart and liver of SPF \nmice, which were primarily of the genera Burkholderia and Ralstonia, functioned \nin organic metabolism, environmental information processing, cellular processes, \nand genetic information processing. Lactobacillus sp. were found in the liver \nbut not in the heart. The heart had a lower bacterial abundance than the liver. \nA culturomic assay of the heart flushing liquid indicated that the dominant \nspecies of bacteria were Ralstonia pickettii, Ralstonia sp._3PA37C10, Ralstonia \ninsidiosa, Burkholderia lata, unclassified _g_ Ralstonia, and unclassified _p_ \nPseudomonadota. Intrinsic bacteria exist in the heart due to their inhibitory \naction against pathogenic Escherichia coli. After, the mice were supplemented \nwith Ligilactobacillus salivarius to optimize the microbiota levels. The \ndominant bacterial phyla in the liver and heart were Bacillota, Bacteroidota, \nPseudomonadota, Thermodesulfobacteriota, andActinomycetota, which comprised \n98.2% of total bacteria. The genus Lactobacillus was also abundant. Core \nbacteria such as Lactobacillus reuteri are translocated from the intestine to \nthe heart and liver. The enriched bacterial composition up-regulated \nanti-oxidation capacities in the heart and liver. The levels of reactive oxygen \nspecies and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly improved compared to \nthose in control (P < 0.01). In conclusion, intrinsic bacteria present in the \nheart and liver alleviate infection by pathogens, environmental and genetic \ninformation processing, and cellular processes during heat stress exposure.

Early \nand accessible diagnosis and targeted treatment are crucial. This study aims to \nexplore the relationship between microbes, metabolic pathways, and blood test \nindicators in sepsis patients and develop a machine learning model for clinical \ndiagnosis.\nMETHODS: Blood samples from sepsis patients were sequenced. α-diversity and \nβ-diversity analyses were performed to compare the microbial diversity between \nthe sepsis group and the normal group. Correlation analysis was conducted on \nmicrobes, metabolic pathways, and blood test indicators. In addition, a model \nwas developed based on medical records and radiomic features using machine \nlearning algorithms.\nRESULTS: The results of α-diversity and β-diversity analyses showed that the \nmicrobial diversity of sepsis group was significantly higher than that of normal \ngroup (p < 0.05). The top 10 microbial abundances in the sepsis and normal \ngroups were Vitis vinifera, Mycobacterium canettii, Solanum pennellii, Ralstonia \ninsidiosa, Ananas comosus, Moraxella osloensis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus \nhominis, Camelina sativa, and Cutibacterium acnes. The enriched metabolic \npathways mainly included Protein families: genetic information processing, \nTranslation, Protein families: signaling and cellular processes, and \nUnclassified: genetic information processing. The correlation analysis revealed \na significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between IL-6 and Membrane \ntransport. Metabolism of other amino acids showed a significant positive \ncorrelation (p < 0.05) with Cutibacterium acnes, Ralstonia insidiosa, Moraxella \nosloensis, and Staphylococcus hominis. Ananas comosus showed a significant \npositive correlation (p < 0.05) with Poorly characterized and Unclassified: \nmetabolism. Blood test-related indicators showed a significant negative \ncorrelation (p < 0.05) with microorganisms. Logistic regression (LR) was used as \nthe optimal model in six machine learning models based on medical records and \nradiomic features. The nomogram, calibration curves, and AUC values demonstrated \nthat LR performed best for prediction.\nDISCUSSION: This study provides insights into the relationship between microbes, \nmetabolic pathways, and blood test indicators in sepsis. The developed machine \nlearning model shows potential for aiding in clinical diagnosis. However, \nfurther research is needed to validate and improve the model.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Hu, Zhi, Wu, Tao, Zhang, Li, Li, Pan, Fan and Li.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmed.2024.1400166\nPMCID: PMC11449737\nPMID: 39371337\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

The presence of the microbiome has recently \nbeen confirmed in thrombus, suggesting a novel approach to distinguish cerebral \nthrombi of different origins. However, little is known about whether there is \nheterogeneity in microbiological colonization of cerebral thrombi of different \nsources.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Forty patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke were \nincluded and clinical data were collected. Metagenomic next-generation \nsequencing was adopted to detect bacterial and genomic signatures of human \ncerebral thrombi samples. We found similar species diversity between the \nlarge-artery atherosclerosis thrombi and cardioembolic thrombi but different \nspecies composition and distribution of cerebral thrombus microbiota. Compared \nwith the group with cardioembolism, the group with large-artery atherosclerosis \nshowed a significantly higher relative abundance of Ralstonia insidiosa among \nthe top 10 bacterial species in cerebral thrombi. Twenty operational taxonomy \nunits were correlated with 11 clinical indicators of ischemic stroke.

However, infections caused by Ralstonia \ninsidiosa are still rare. Only a few cases of respiratory infections and \nbloodstream infections have been reported, none of which involved meningitis. To \nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of meningitis caused \nby R. insidiosa worldwide. It is necessary to report and review this case.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of meningitis caused by R. insidiosa \nfollowing lumbar surgery in China. The patient exhibited symptoms of headache, \ndizziness, and recurrent fever. The fever remained unresolved after empiric \nantibiotic therapy with intravenous cefotaxime and vancomycin in the initial \ndays. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture yielded Gram-negative non-fermentative \nbacteria, which were identified as R. insidiosa. As there was a lack of \nantibiotic susceptibility testing results, clinical pharmacists conducted a \nliterature review to select appropriate antibiotics. The patient's condition \nimproved after receiving effective treatment with intravenous cefepime and \nlevofloxacin.\nCONCLUSIONS: Uncommon pathogens, such as R. insidiosa, should be considered in \npostoperative central nervous system (CNS) infections, particularly in cases \nwith unsatisfactory results of empiric anti-infective therapy. This is the first \nreported case of meningitis caused by R. insidiosa worldwide. MALDI-TOF MS \nprovides rapid and accurate identification of this pathogen. The antibiotic \nsusceptibility testing results of R. indiosa may be interpreted based on the \nbreakpoints for Pseudomonas spp., Burkholderia cepacia spp., and Acinetobacter \nspp. Our case presents a potential option for empiric therapy against this \npathogen, at least in the local area. This is crucial to minimize the severity \nand mortality rates associated with meningitis. Standardized antibiotic \nsusceptibility testing and breakpoints for the Ralstonia genus should be \nestablished in the future as cases accumulate. Cefepime and levofloxacin may be \npotential antibiotics for infections caused by R. indiosa.\n\n© 2023.

Although PHB exhibits inherent biodegradability, its \nnatural degradation can be slow and inefficient in real-world conditions. This \nstudy employed the Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) method to enhance the \ndegradation of PHB in natural environments. This study started with an \nexamination of the degradation processes of PHB and poly (butylene \nadipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) mulch films in soil using two bacterial \nstrains, Ralstonia insidiosa C1 and Comamonas sp. K5. A two stage ALE \nmethodology achieved 70-80\xa0% degradation of PHB, while a four-stage approach \nresulted 100\xa0% degradation. R. insidiosa C1 degraded 100\xa0% PHB within 144\xa0h at \n1.5\xa0% (w/v), whereas Comamonas sp. K5 within 120\xa0h at 1.0\xa0% (w/v). Further, the \ngene expression during ALE showed that a 1\xa0% (w/v) PHB significantly increased \nthe gene expression levels at 1.7 times than the baseline. Conversely, the 2\xa0% \n(w/v) PHB resulted in lower gene expressions indicating a correlation between \nALE's degradation activity enhancement and phaZ gene expression levels. The \nidentification of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) and acetoacetate via NMR analysis \nsubstantiates that Ralstonia sp. C1 effectively degrades PHB into 3-HB as a \nprincipal metabolite resulting from the hydrolysis of PHB's ester bonds. \nFinally, strain C1's PHB production was examined in the context of ALE; a \nreduction in PHB production compared to non-ALE, suggesting that ALE may \ncompromise PHB production. The study advocates further research into ALE's \neffectiveness for synthetic and bioplastic degradation in real-world scenarios, \nparticularly under varying environmental conditions.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

We observed stage-specific gene \nexpression changes of disrupting energy metabolism and immune responses, \nalongside microbial shifts shaping the NAFLD microenvironment. Additionally, we \nidentified 5,537, 1,937, 1,485, and 2,933 host-microbiota interactions in \ncontrol, NAFL, Borderline, and NASH samples, respectively. Escherichia coli and \nActinomyces naeslundii dominated the interaction network in control but were \nreplaced by Sphingomonadales and Sphingomonadaceae in disease stages from NAFL, \npreceding the transcriptomic tipping point observed in Borderline. In NASH, \ninteractions significantly weakened, accompanied by the loss of mutualistic \ninteractions between bacteria such as Bacillales, Ralstonia insidiosa, \nSphingomonadaceae, and host mitophagy genes including SQSTM1, OPTN, and BNIP3L. \nSingle-cell data sets confirmed these interactions were co-localized in \nmacrophages and monocytes in control, which shifted to hepatocytes and \nendothelial cells in NAFLD. Shifts in host-microbial interaction signal early \nmicroenvironment changes. Disturbed host-microbiota interactions impacting \nmitophagy can trigger a pro-inflammatory hepatic microenvironment, potentially \ndriving disease progression.IMPORTANCEThis study integrated multiple cohorts to \nuncover fundamental and generalizable signals in the progression of nonalcoholic \nfatty liver disease. Key changes in both liver gene expression and microbiota \nwere identified across disease stages, with microbial composition and \ninteractions with host offering earlier insights into microenvironmental \nchanges. Notably, host-microbiota interactions related to mitophagy, crucial in \nearly stages, were destroyed in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. This disruption \nmay contribute to the worsening inflammation and disease progression.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/spectrum.00100-25\nPMCID: PMC12211054\nPMID: 40401922 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest."},

Early \nand accessible diagnosis and targeted treatment are crucial. This study aims to \nexplore the relationship between microbes, metabolic pathways, and blood test \nindicators in sepsis patients and develop a machine learning model for clinical \ndiagnosis.\nMETHODS: Blood samples from sepsis patients were sequenced. α-diversity and \nβ-diversity analyses were performed to compare the microbial diversity between \nthe sepsis group and the normal group. Correlation analysis was conducted on \nmicrobes, metabolic pathways, and blood test indicators. In addition, a model \nwas developed based on medical records and radiomic features using machine \nlearning algorithms.\nRESULTS: The results of α-diversity and β-diversity analyses showed that the \nmicrobial diversity of sepsis group was significantly higher than that of normal \ngroup (p < 0.05). The top 10 microbial abundances in the sepsis and normal \ngroups were Vitis vinifera, Mycobacterium canettii, Solanum pennellii, Ralstonia \ninsidiosa, Ananas comosus, Moraxella osloensis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus \nhominis, Camelina sativa, and Cutibacterium acnes. The enriched metabolic \npathways mainly included Protein families: genetic information processing, \nTranslation, Protein families: signaling and cellular processes, and \nUnclassified: genetic information processing. The correlation analysis revealed \na significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between IL-6 and Membrane \ntransport. Metabolism of other amino acids showed a significant positive \ncorrelation (p < 0.05) with Cutibacterium acnes, Ralstonia insidiosa, Moraxella \nosloensis, and Staphylococcus hominis. Ananas comosus showed a significant \npositive correlation (p < 0.05) with Poorly characterized and Unclassified: \nmetabolism. Blood test-related indicators showed a significant negative \ncorrelation (p < 0.05) with microorganisms. Logistic regression (LR) was used as \nthe optimal model in six machine learning models based on medical records and \nradiomic features. The nomogram, calibration curves, and AUC values demonstrated \nthat LR performed best for prediction.\nDISCUSSION: This study provides insights into the relationship between microbes, \nmetabolic pathways, and blood test indicators in sepsis. The developed machine \nlearning model shows potential for aiding in clinical diagnosis. However, \nfurther research is needed to validate and improve the model.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Hu, Zhi, Wu, Tao, Zhang, Li, Li, Pan, Fan and Li.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmed.2024.1400166\nPMCID: PMC11449737\nPMID: 39371337\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

The presence of the microbiome has recently \nbeen confirmed in thrombus, suggesting a novel approach to distinguish cerebral \nthrombi of different origins. However, little is known about whether there is \nheterogeneity in microbiological colonization of cerebral thrombi of different \nsources.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Forty patients experiencing acute ischemic stroke were \nincluded and clinical data were collected. Metagenomic next-generation \nsequencing was adopted to detect bacterial and genomic signatures of human \ncerebral thrombi samples. We found similar species diversity between the \nlarge-artery atherosclerosis thrombi and cardioembolic thrombi but different \nspecies composition and distribution of cerebral thrombus microbiota. Compared \nwith the group with cardioembolism, the group with large-artery atherosclerosis \nshowed a significantly higher relative abundance of Ralstonia insidiosa among \nthe top 10 bacterial species in cerebral thrombi.

Mutating a gene encoding a \nputative sensing/signaling protein had little transcriptomic effect on Rps \nstrain GMI1000 in culture. However, when the mutant grew in tomato, over 180 \ngenes were differentially expressed relative to the wild type. The gene was \ntherefore named rprR for Ralstonia plant-responsive regulator. In planta, the \n∆rprR mutant dysregulated genes for diverse traits, including stress response, \ndegradation of phenolic compounds, motility, attachment, and production of \nextracellular polysaccharide (EPS), which is a key bacterial wilt virulence \nfactor. Quantifying Rps EPS by ELISA found increased levels in stems of plants \ninfected with ∆rprR as compared to the wild type. Functional assays showed that \n∆rprR is defective in attachment to tomato roots, colonization of tomato stems, \nand bacterial wilt virulence. In a rich medium, ∆rprR formed biofilm normally, \nbut the mutant formed less biofilm in tomato stem homogenate and in tomato xylem \nsap under flow. This phenotype correlates with the mutant's altered expression \nof EPS biosynthetic genes and aberrant extracellular matrix. When grown in \ntomato stem homogenate, ∆rprR produced 57% more of the bacterial signal cyclic \ndi-GMP (c-di-GMP) than the wild type. This is consistent with the presence, in \nRprR, of predicted c-di-GMP-modulating domains. Together, these findings reveal \nthat RprR, which is highly conserved across plant pathogenic Ralstonia, \nmodulates several bacterial wilt virulence traits in response to the plant \nhost.IMPORTANCEMembers of the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) \ncause bacterial wilt, a globally destructive disease of market and subsistence \ncrops. Like other plant-associated microbes, bacteria in the RSSC must integrate \na complex array of biotic and abiotic signals to successfully infect plant \nhosts. All RSSC genomes encode an unusual protein, termed RprR, that contains \nmultiple sensing and signaling domains, including two putative modulators of the \nsecondary messenger c-di-GMP. Deleting RprR in Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum \naffected many virulence properties, including production of biofilm and \nexopolysaccharide, and increased intracellular c-di-GMP levels, all in a \nstrictly plant-dependent fashion. While c-di-GMP has been investigated in other \nplant pathogenic bacteria, this is the first report of its role in the RSSC. \nMost importantly, rprR was required for Ralstonia to effectively colonize plants \nand cause wilt disease. Thus, RprR is a plant-responsive sensor-regulator that \ncontrols pathogen adaptation to the host environment and virulence.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.02912-25\nPMID: 41358747"},

However, potato bacterial wilt, a destructive soil-borne disease caused \nby Ralstonia solanacearum, poses a huge threat to global potato production and \nquality, leading to serious economic losses worldwide. The wild potato species \nSolanum commersonii exhibits resistance to bacterial wilt, but the underlying \nmolecular mechanisms remain largely obscure.\nRESULTS: In this study, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs \n(microRNAs), phased secondary short-interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs), along with \ntheir target transcripts, and elucidated the potential pathways involved in \nbacterial wilt resistance through high-throughput sequencing analyses of \ntranscriptome, sRNAome, and degradome on normal and R. solanacearum-infected \npotato roots, which were collected from the susceptible diploid potato clone S. \ntuberosum group Phureja SP15-65 and the resistant diploid S. commersonii \ngermplasm CM804. The results revealed that 3,434 and 1,045 differentially \nexpressed genes (DEGs) were identified in susceptible SP15-65 and resistant \nCM804, respectively, with 7,652 DEGs identified between SP15-65 and CM804 upon \npathogen inoculation. 23 transcripts specifically expressed in CM804 were \nidentified to be responsive to R. solanacearum infection. Functional enrichment \nanalysis of DEGs revealed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) \nactivation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, calcium signaling, hormone \nsignaling, secondary metabolism, and transcriptional reprogramming for defense \nwere potential pathways in potato root response to R. solanacearum infection. \nFurthermore, 115 unique known and 147 putative novel miRNAs showed differential \nexpression in SP15-65 or CM804 after pathogen infection. Among these \ndifferentially expressed miRNAs, some miR482, miR6024, and miR390 family members \ntriggered the biosynthesis of phasiRNAs through the cleavage of \nphasiRNA-generating (PHAS) precursor transcripts, as validated by \ndegradome-seq.\xa0The resulting phasiRNAs directed the cleavage of their downstream \ntarget mRNAs. Six miRNA-mRNA pairs and four pairs of phasiRNA-mRNA displayed \nnegatively correlated expression changes, which may be related to bacterial wilt \nresistance in potato.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study sheds lights on the regulatory roles of small RNAs in \npotato resistance against bacterial wilt, and will provide a theoretical \nfoundation for the cultivation of disease-resistant potato varieties.\n\n© 2025.

Mutating a gene encoding a \nputative sensing/signaling protein had little transcriptomic effect on Rps \nstrain GMI1000 in culture. However, when the mutant grew in tomato, over 180 \ngenes were differentially expressed relative to the wild type. The gene was \ntherefore named rprR for Ralstonia plant-responsive regulator. In planta, the \n∆rprR mutant dysregulated genes for diverse traits, including stress response, \ndegradation of phenolic compounds, motility, attachment, and production of \nextracellular polysaccharide (EPS), which is a key bacterial wilt virulence \nfactor. Quantifying Rps EPS by ELISA found increased levels in stems of plants \ninfected with ∆rprR as compared to the wild type. Functional assays showed that \n∆rprR is defective in attachment to tomato roots, colonization of tomato stems, \nand bacterial wilt virulence. In a rich medium, ∆rprR formed biofilm normally, \nbut the mutant formed less biofilm in tomato stem homogenate and in tomato xylem \nsap under flow. This phenotype correlates with the mutant's altered expression \nof EPS biosynthetic genes and aberrant extracellular matrix. When grown in \ntomato stem homogenate, ∆rprR produced 57% more of the bacterial signal cyclic \ndi-GMP (c-di-GMP) than the wild type. This is consistent with the presence, in \nRprR, of predicted c-di-GMP-modulating domains. Together, these findings reveal \nthat RprR, which is highly conserved across plant pathogenic Ralstonia, \nmodulates several bacterial wilt virulence traits in response to the plant \nhost.IMPORTANCEMembers of the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) \ncause bacterial wilt, a globally destructive disease of market and subsistence \ncrops. Like other plant-associated microbes, bacteria in the RSSC must integrate \na complex array of biotic and abiotic signals to successfully infect plant \nhosts. All RSSC genomes encode an unusual protein, termed RprR, that contains \nmultiple sensing and signaling domains, including two putative modulators of the \nsecondary messenger c-di-GMP. Deleting RprR in Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum \naffected many virulence properties, including production of biofilm and \nexopolysaccharide, and increased intracellular c-di-GMP levels, all in a \nstrictly plant-dependent fashion. While c-di-GMP has been investigated in other \nplant pathogenic bacteria, this is the first report of its role in the RSSC. \nMost importantly, rprR was required for Ralstonia to effectively colonize plants \nand cause wilt disease. Thus, RprR is a plant-responsive sensor-regulator that \ncontrols pathogen adaptation to the host environment and virulence.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.02912-25\nPMID: 41358747"},

Intercropping has been proposed as a sustainable \nstrategy to mitigate soil-borne pathogens through rhizosphere interactions. \nHowever, the mechanisms by which tobacco-sweet potato intercropping specifically \naffects the microecological environment and suppresses R. solanacearum remain \npoorly understood. To investigate the effect of the TSP model on the soil-borne \npathogen of bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) in tobacco-growing soil, \nthis study compared and analyzed the characteristics and differences in \nbacterial wilt incidence, Ralstonia solanacearum content, phenolic acid \ncomponents, metabolome, and metagenome between (T) and (TSP) systems. The \nresults showed that compared to the T treatment, the TSP treatment reduced the \nincidence of bacterial wilt in flue-cured tobacco and significantly decreased \nthe abundance of R. solanacearum in the soil by 21.4%, while increasing the \ntotal phenolic acid content by 21.9%. The total phenolic content in the TSP soil \nwas increased by 21.9% compared to T. Differentially abundant metabolites \nbetween TSP and T were primarily enriched in carbohydrate metabolic pathways, \nsuch as nucleotide sugar biosynthesis, fructose, and mannose metabolism. The \ncontent of substances such as rhamnose, D-allose, and mannitol in T-treated soil \nwas 2.14-6.62 times higher than that in TSP-treated soil, with new tobacco \nalkaloids being up to 91.09 times higher. Compared to the T treatment, the TSP \ntreatment significantly increased the relative abundances of Acidobacteriota, \nChloroflexota, Bradyrhizobium, Pseudolabrys, and Sphingomonas by 64.08%, 18.86%, \n23.55%, 21.80%, and 12.98%, respectively. The content of Ralstonia solanacearum \nin the soil was positively correlated with differential metabolites such as \nmannitol, rhamnose, and D-allose (r = 0.8), while negatively correlated with \nphenolic acids such as syringic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and gallic \nacid, as well as microorganisms such as Chloroflexota, Gemmatimonadota, \nAcidobacteriota, and Sphingomonas. In summary, TSP can regulate soil \nmetabolites, phenolic acids, and beneficial microorganisms, forming a \nsynergistic network to suppress the content of Ralstonia solanacearum and reduce \nthe risk of tobacco bacterial wilt. This provides a theoretical basis for \nregulating soil microecology and enhancing crop disease resistance in \nintercropping systems.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Yang, Liu, Guo, Li, Nie, Zhang, Zeng, Wang and Liu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpls.2025.1688379\nPMCID: PMC12666530\nPMID: 41334206\n\nConflict of interest statement: Authors YZ, FW was/were employed by Luzhou \nTobacco Company.

To investigate the effect of the TSP model on the soil-borne \npathogen of bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) in tobacco-growing soil, \nthis study compared and analyzed the characteristics and differences in \nbacterial wilt incidence, Ralstonia solanacearum content, phenolic acid \ncomponents, metabolome, and metagenome between (T) and (TSP) systems. The \nresults showed that compared to the T treatment, the TSP treatment reduced the \nincidence of bacterial wilt in flue-cured tobacco and significantly decreased \nthe abundance of R. solanacearum in the soil by 21.4%, while increasing the \ntotal phenolic acid content by 21.9%. The total phenolic content in the TSP soil \nwas increased by 21.9% compared to T. Differentially abundant metabolites \nbetween TSP and T were primarily enriched in carbohydrate metabolic pathways, \nsuch as nucleotide sugar biosynthesis, fructose, and mannose metabolism. The \ncontent of substances such as rhamnose, D-allose, and mannitol in T-treated soil \nwas 2.14-6.62 times higher than that in TSP-treated soil, with new tobacco \nalkaloids being up to 91.09 times higher. Compared to the T treatment, the TSP \ntreatment significantly increased the relative abundances of Acidobacteriota, \nChloroflexota, Bradyrhizobium, Pseudolabrys, and Sphingomonas by 64.08%, 18.86%, \n23.55%, 21.80%, and 12.98%, respectively. The content of Ralstonia solanacearum \nin the soil was positively correlated with differential metabolites such as \nmannitol, rhamnose, and D-allose (r = 0.8), while negatively correlated with \nphenolic acids such as syringic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, and gallic \nacid, as well as microorganisms such as Chloroflexota, Gemmatimonadota, \nAcidobacteriota, and Sphingomonas. In summary, TSP can regulate soil \nmetabolites, phenolic acids, and beneficial microorganisms, forming a \nsynergistic network to suppress the content of Ralstonia solanacearum and reduce \nthe risk of tobacco bacterial wilt. This provides a theoretical basis for \nregulating soil microecology and enhancing crop disease resistance in \nintercropping systems.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Yang, Liu, Guo, Li, Nie, Zhang, Zeng, Wang and Liu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpls.2025.1688379\nPMCID: PMC12666530\nPMID: 41334206\n\nConflict of interest statement: Authors YZ, FW was/were employed by Luzhou \nTobacco Company.

However, the mechanisms \nunderlying its pathogenicity, particularly in comparison to environmental \nstrains such as S. stutzeri (SS), remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to \ninvestigate the systemic effects of PMSS by comparing the serum metabolite \nprofiles and inflammatory responses induced by SS and PMSS infections in a mouse \nmodel. Mice infected with PMSS exhibited marked alterations in serum \nmetabolites, many of which were associated with enhanced pro-inflammatory \nsignaling and the suppression of anti-inflammatory pathways. These metabolic \nchanges were accompanied by elevated levels of circulating inflammatory \ncytokines, indicating a link between PMSS infection, metabolic dysregulation, \nand systemic inflammation. Our findings demonstrate that PMSS-associated \nbacterium, induces inflammation through modulation of host serum metabolites. \nThis study suggests that PM-induced changes in serum metabolites contribute to \ninflammation, highlighting the need for further research on the systemic effects \nof biologically active components within particulate matter.\n\nDOI: 10.4014/jmb.2507.07027\nPMCID: PMC12602879\nPMID: 41183799 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest The authors have no \nfinancial conflicts of interest to declare.'},

This \ncomprehensive study investigated the potential of the novel deep-sea bacterium \nStutzerimonas frequens GOM2 to degrade polyurethane (PU), focusing on its \necological safety, including pathogenicity and survival in zebrafish embryo \npopulation controls, and the potential for plastic recycling. The marine isolate \nexhibited the capacity to grow and present clearance halos in functional \nscreenings using two types of commercial water-based dispersions of polyester-PU \n(Impranil and Polycrylic). The biodegradation of the PU Impranil by the GOM2 \nstrain was subsequently assessed in marine microcosms by monitoring bacterial \ngrowth and metabolic activity over time. Physicochemical analyses (including \nGPC, FTIR, and GC-MS) were used to monitor polymer breakdown by molecular weight \nloss, changes in functional groups, the disappearance of toxic PU precursors and \nthe appearance of secondary metabolites. GC-MS analysis identified several \nmetabolic intermediates, including plastic and bioplastic precursors, and \ncompounds with potential pharmaceutical applications. Genomic analyses revealed \ngenes encoding enzymes associated with plastic degradation, and the bacterium \nwas found to be nonpathogenic. This strain successfully reversed the embryonic \nlethality of Impranil in zebrafish via biodegradation of PU, demonstrating the \npotential for this strain to reduce the toxicity of this plastic. Taken \ntogether, our results highlight the potential applicability of S. frequens GOM2 \nin future biotechnological applications that have significant implications for \nthe blue economy.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Marine sponges \nare a rich source of promising bioactive compounds. Due to their sessile nature \nand filter-feeding lifestyle, sponges are prone to attack by competitors, \npredators, and pathogens. To combat these threats, they produce a diverse array \nof bioactive compounds. Notably, the microbial communities residing within the \nsponges make many of these beneficial compounds. Twenty-one bacterial isolates \nfrom various marine sponges from the Indian coast were selected for this study. \nThe bacterial isolates were fermented to obtain crude extracts, which were then \nscreened against critical bacterial pathogens. Based on the MIC (minimum \ninhibitory concentration) results, two isolates, Bacillus velezensis NIO_002 and \nStutzerimonas stutzeri NIO_003 showing good activity, were characterized by \nmorphological, biochemical, and molecular methods. Genome mining predicted \nmultiple antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters, most of which showed a high \ndegree of similarity to known gene clusters, and some with low or no similarity \nwhich may be indicative of novel gene clusters. LC-MS (liquid \nchromatography-mass spectrometry) data revealed the putative presence of certain \nantibacterial compounds previously reported in the literature. To our knowledge, \nthis is the first study to report the antimicrobial activity of marine \nsponge-associated Bacillus velezensis and Stutzerimonas stutzeri strains \ncharacterized by whole genome sequencing, thereby indicating the novelty of our \nstrains. This study emphasizes the potential of our bacterial isolates for \nfurther development as a source of promising antibiotics to address the \nescalating challenge of drug-resistant pathogens.\n\n© 2025.

The genus includes at least 16 \nidentified species. Stutzerimonas nitrititolerans, previously known as \nPseudomonas nitrititolerans, was initially isolated from a bioreactor. Only one \ncase of human infection has been reported to date, and its pathogenicity remains \nunknown.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of community-acquired S. nitrititolerans \nbacteremia in a 77-year-old Japanese man with a sacral pressure ulcer. On \nadmission for cerebral infarction, empirical ampicillin/sulbactam was \nadministered because of an infected sacral pressure ulcer. Blood cultures \nrevealed Gram-negative bacilli. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization \ntime-of-flight mass spectrometry was unable to identify the species, but 16\xa0S \nribosomal RNA gene sequencing identified the isolate NR5426 as S. \nnitrititolerans. Despite negative results for common carbapenem-resistance \ngenes, the strain showed possible metallo-beta-lactamase production. The patient \nwas treated with piperacillin/tazobactam and recovered.\nCONCLUSIONS: This case confirms that S. nitrititolerans can cause infection in \nhumans and highlights the antimicrobial susceptibility profile and the treatment \nstrategy for infections caused by this rare bacterium.

This study analyzed the genomic features, antimicrobial resistance, and \nvirulence factors of the isolated strain through whole genome sequencing (WGS).\nMETHODS: The bacterial isolate from the peritoneal dialysis fluid was named \nPDI170223, and preliminary identification was conducted through Matrix-assisted \nlaser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). WGS \nof the strain PDI170223 was performed using the Illumina platform, and a \nphylogenetic tree was constructed based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences. \nAntimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) was conducted using the TDR-200B2 \nautomatic bacteria identification/drug sensitivity tester.\nRESULTS: S. nitrititolerans may emerge as a human pathogen due to its numerous \nvirulence genes, including those encoding toxins, and those involved in \nflagellum and biofilm formation. The AST results revealed that the strain is \nmultidrug- and carbapenem-resistant.

In this study, plastic degrading microorganisms were isolated from \nagriculture soil and metal nanoparticles such as Zinc oxide (ZnO) and \nZinc-Magnesium oxide (ZnO-MgO) nanoparticles were synthesized using \nCo-precipitation method. Thus prepared inorganic metal nanoparticles were \nsubsequently added to enhance the microbial degradation action.

The \nplastic films treated with isolated strain, showed 65% of degradation efficiency \nrate in the presence of synthesised nanoparticles as enhancers.

We \nsought to analyze the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 one year after COVID-19 in \nchildren under 18 years, vaccinated or unvaccinated. Blood samples were \ncollected during the acute phase, the convalescence stage and one-year \npost-disease. Vaccinated adults who had COVID-19 during the same timeframe were \nanalyzed for comparison. Serum SARS-CoV-2\xa0S IgG was assessed using immunoassay, \nand neutralizing activity was evaluated using a SARS-CoV-2\xa0S-pseudotyped \nlentivirus assay. Seventy-five children were enrolled, with a median age of 8 \nyears (IQR 3-12), and 35% were vaccinated. Forty-nine adults were included, with \na median age of 34 years (IQR 29-44). Among unvaccinated children, median \nSARS-CoV-2\xa0S IgG levels one year after COVID-19 tended to decrease 2-fold \ncompared to convalescent levels. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were notably elevated in \nchildren with two or three COVID-19 vaccine doses compared to unvaccinated \nindividuals. Children who received mRNA vaccines exhibited higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG \ntiters (p\u2009=\u20090.0028) and neutralizing antibodies (p\u2009=\u20090.0120) compared to those \nwho received inactivated vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 IgG showed no correlation with the \nseverity of the initial illness or the presence of comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 IgG \ndid not significantly differ between vaccinated children and adults with the \nsame vaccination status. Among unvaccinated children, convalescent levels of \nIL-1 β and IL-4 positively correlated with one-year antibody responses. This \nwork highlights the significance of vaccinating children to sustain a lasting \nhumoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2, even after infection.\n\n© 2025.

Then we assessed its impact on the proliferation \nand functionality of Treg cells by flow cytometry and PCR. The synergistic \neffects of mutated IL-2 and MSC on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice were \nevaluated through the infusion of lentiviral-transduced umbilical cord-derived \nmesenchymal stromal cell (UC-MSC) for CIA treatment and through pathological \nsection staining to assess inflammatory joint injury, cartilage destruction, and \nosteoclast infiltration.\nRESULTS: Mutant IL-2 demonstrated targeted enhancement of both the proportion \nand proliferative activity of Treg cells with a diminished capacity to stimulate \nthe proliferation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells relative to wild-type IL-2. \nMoreover, MSC-mutant IL-2 significantly augmented the proportion of Treg cells \ncompared to either MSC or mutant IL-2 in isolation. Treatment with MSC-mutant \nIL-2 infusion in CIA mice ameliorated arthritis symptoms and reduced \ninflammatory infiltration and cartilage damage in their joints.\nCONCLUSION: Mutant IL-2 enhances Treg function and proliferation while exerting \nreduced effects on CD8+ T and NK cell activation. MSC expressing mutant IL-2 \ndemonstrates therapeutic benefits in CIA by increasing the proportion of Treg \ncells and reducing the proportion of CD8+ T cells.\n\n© 2025.

Exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles (30-150 nm) that play \na key role in intercellular communication, have a dual role in HIV-1 \npathogenesis and therapy. Regarding pathogenesis, this review elucidates how \nHIV-1 exploits the exosome pathway-hijacking the Endosomal Sorting Complex \nRequired for Transport(ESCRT)machinery for viral budding and selectively \npackaging viral components, such as the accessory protein Nef, to enhance \ninfectivity, promote immune evasion, and establish latent reservoirs. \nConversely, host cells utilize exosomes to mount antiviral defense by packaging \nand transmitting restriction factors, such as APOBEC3G, to recipient cells. \nFurthermore, exosomal cargo serves as promising biomarkers for disease \nmonitoring, and exosomes themselves are emerging as versatile therapeutic \nnanocarriers. We highlight that plant-derived exosomes offer unique advantages, \nincluding low immunogenicity and high scalability, for delivering \nnext-generation antiviral agents or gene editing tools. In summary, \nunderstanding the multifaceted roles of exosomes provides crucial mechanistic \ninsights into HIV-1 pathogenesis and unveils innovative strategies toward a \nfunctional cure.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Lu, Lin, Yang and Li.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1634726\nPMCID: PMC12675381\nPMID: 41357234 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'}],

The cellular expressions of Bax, \ncaspase-3, Bcl-2, and the PI3K/AKT pathway proteins were analyzed using Western \nblotting, and the expression of miR-23a was detected with RT-qPCR. KGN cell \nmodels with lentivirus-mediated miR-23a overexpression or knockdown were used to \nverify the therapeutic mechanism of LBP.\nRESULTS: Cisplatin treatment significantly inhibited cell viability, induced \napoptosis, decreased AMH level, caused ultrastructural abnormalities, increased \nBax and caspase-3 expression, and lowered Bcl-2 expression in KGN cells. \nCisplatin also suppressed the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and \nupregulated miR-23a expression in the cells. LBP intervention obviously \nalleviated cisplatin-induced injuries in KGN cells, and in particular, LBP \ntreatment at the medium dose for 24 h significantly improved KGN cell viability, \nreduced apoptosis, enhanced their endocrine function, and ameliorated \nultrastructural abnormalities. Mechanistically, medium-dose LBP obviously \nactivated the PI3K/AKT pathway by downregulating miR-23a in cisplatin-treated \ncells, subsequently inhibiting Bax and caspase-3 while upregulating Bcl-2. \nOverexpression of miR-23a weakened while knockdown of miR-23a significantly \nenhanced the protective effects of LBP.\nCONCLUSIONS: LBP alleviates cisplatin-induced apoptosis in KGN cells by \ninhibiting miR-23a expression and activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, suggesting a \npotential therapeutic strategy for ovarian function preservation.\n\nPublisher: 目的: 研究枸杞多糖（LBP）对顺铂损伤的卵巢颗粒细胞的保护作用及其潜在机制。方法: 采用顺铂（2.5 µg/mL，24 \nh）诱导人颗粒细胞样肿瘤细胞系（KGN）建立KGN损伤模型，采用不同浓度LBP（100、500、1000 \nmg/L）干预受损KGN，各组细胞分别用细胞计数试剂盒-8检测细胞活力，流式细胞术检测凋亡率，ELISA法检测抗苗勒管激素（AMH）水平，透射电镜观察超微结构，Western \nblotting检测凋亡相关蛋白（Bax、caspase-3、Bcl-2）及PI3K/AKT信号通路的表达情况，RT-qPCR法检测微小RNA（miR）-23a表达情况。通过慢病毒转染构建miR-23a过表达/敲低模型，验证LBP的作用机制。结果: \n顺铂抑制KGN活力（P<0.01），诱导凋亡（P<0.01），降低AMH水平（P<0.01），造成染色质凝聚、细胞核固缩、细胞质空泡化等超微结构异常，并增加促凋亡基因Bax、caspase-3的表达（P<0.01），减少抑凋亡基因Bcl-2的表达（P<0.05），下调PI3K/AKT信号通路的表达与活化（P<0.01），上调miR-23a的含量（P<0.01）。LBP干预可不同程度地逆转上述损伤，中剂量LBP作用24 \nh可改善KGN细胞活力、凋亡率、内分泌功能和超微结构（P<0.01）。中剂量LBP通过下调miR-23a（P<0.01）激活PI3K/AKT通路（P<0.01），抑制Bax、caspase-3（P<0.01），上调Bcl-2（P<0.05）。miR-23a过表达削弱LBP的保护作用，而敲低miR-23a则增强其疗效（P<0.01）。结论: \nLBP通过抑制miR-23a表达，激活PI3K/AKT通路，抑制顺铂诱导的KGN凋亡，为保护卵巢功能提供了潜在治疗策略。.\n\nDOI: 10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2025.11.06\nPMCID: PMC12676684\nPMID: 41311075 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'},

Hence, a deeper understanding of the changes in the microbiome, \nits function and metabolites, and their interactions prior to HIV-1 infection is \npotentially important for HIV-1 prevention strategies. Using stool, oral washes, \nand plasma biospecimens obtained from men who have sex with men (MSM) and who \nwere without HIV-1, we found several differences in microbial ecologies, gene \nfunctions, and metabolites between MSM who became HIV-1 infected (Pre-HIV) \nwithin six months and those who remained HIV-1 uninfected (Non-HIV). The Pre-HIV \ngroup had an enrichment of enzymes involved in purine metabolism, lower amino \nacid metabolism, and higher oxidative stress before the infection compared to \nthe Non-HIV group. We also introduced a novel and broadly applicable \ntaxon-specific measure of DISruption in COrrelations (DISCO) with other \nfeatures, such as microbial taxa and metabolites in a given group (e.g., Pre-HIV \ngroup) relative to a reference group (e.g., Non-HIV group). Using DISCO, we \nidentified several gut and oral species with disrupted correlations prior to \nHIV-1 infection. Application of DISCO to external datasets revealed that \nPrevotella spp. are consistently disrupted in their correlations across multiple \ncohorts prior to or following HIV-1 infection.\n\n© 2025.

The cellular effects of \nadiponectin on trophoblast are mainly mediated by adiponectin receptor isoform 2 \n(AdipoR2) resulting in the activation of PPARα and synthesis of ceramides, which \ninhibit insulin and mTOR signaling. We have recently demonstrated that \ntrophoblast-specific overexpression of AdipoR2 in pregnant mice inhibits \nplacental mTORC1 signaling and nutrient transport, resulting in fetal growth \nrestriction. Trophoblast mTORC1 signaling is a positive regulator of \nmitochondrial respiration. However, it is unknown if placental adiponectin \nsignaling is mechanistically linked to mitochondrial function. We hypothesized \nthat trophoblast-specific overexpression of AdipoR2 in pregnant mice decreases \nplacental oxidative phosphorylation. At Embryonic day (E) 3.5, blastocysts from \nsuper-ovulated, time-mated B6D2F1 female mice were collected and transduced with \nlentivirus constructs for AdipoR2-overexpression (AdipoR2-OX) or scramble (SCR) \nsequences. The blastocysts were surgically transferred to pseudo-pregnant CD-1 \nrecipient dams. Following euthanasia at E18.5, we separated the labyrinth and \nthe junctional zone. In the labyrinth, AdipoR2 overexpression significantly \ninhibited placental mitochondrial GMPP respiration as determined by \nhigh-resolution respirometry. Moreover, placental AdiopoR2-OX decreased GLUD1, \nTOM22 and PGC1α protein expression. In the junctional zone, we found no \nsignificant differences between control (SCR) and AdipoR2-OX groups. In \nconclusion, our data suggests that maternal adiponectin signaling in the \ntrophoblast decreases placental mitochondrial respiration, specifically in the \nlabyrinth zone. This effect is possibly mediated by inhibition of mTORC1 and \ndecreased expression of PGC1α.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

This subset of \nimmunological non-responders (INRs) has yet to undergo a comprehensive analysis \nof immunological profiles, and no definitive cytological diagnosis has been \nestablished. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the immunological profiles \nof INRs, immunological responders (IRs), and healthy control individuals (HCs) \nvia single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) \nrepertoire sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and \nidentified a relatively small population of mucosal-associated invariant T \n(MAIT) cells in INRs. This finding was recapitulated in rhesus macaques infected \nwith simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Specifically, the population of the \nnaïve MAIT cell subtype was significantly lower in INRs than in IRs, and the \nmajority of MAIT cells were CD8+ cell subsets. Further characteristic analysis \nof MAIT cells via the transcriptome revealed decreased expression of \ncytotoxicity-related genes in INRs, while displaying increased expression of \ngenes involved in TGF-β receptor signaling. In summary, by conducting a \ncomparative analysis, this study revealed a correlation between the decreased \nproportion of naïve MAIT cells and impaired immune reconstitution in INRs. This \nfinding highlights a particular cell subset that may play a pivotal role in the \nincomplete immune reconstitution, and suggests a plausible cellular target for \nthe modulation of INRs.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Current \nfirst-line therapies include nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) and pegylated \ninterferon-α (PEG-IFN-α). A functional cure, defined as sustained HBsAg loss for \n≥ 24\xa0weeks, undetectable hepatitis B e antigen/HBV DNA, and normal liver \nfunction, is the ideal and achievable treatment endpoint for chronic HBV \ninfection. This review focuses on PEG-IFN-α-induced functional cure in special \npopulations with chronic HBV infection, including patients with partial response \nor low-level viremia (LLV), fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis, HBV-related \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), HBV/human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) \ncoinfection, and pediatric patients. PEG-IFN-α enhances the complete virological \nresponse and HBsAg loss rate in CHB patients with partial virological responses \nto NAs or LLV. PEG-IFN-α improves liver histology and promotes liver fibrosis \nregression in compensated cirrhosis. PEG-IFN-α not only decreases HCC incidence \nand recurrence but also improves overall survival in patients with HBV-related \nHCC after curative treatment. Patients living with HBV/HIV-1 coinfection have a \nhigh rate of HBsAg loss/seroconversion in response to effective antiretroviral \ntherapy, and the administration of add-on PEG-IFN-α may further increase the \nrate of HBV functional cure. IFN-α/PEG-IFN-α-based therapy is beneficial for \nyounger children with chronic HBV infection despite the viral load, HBeAg, and \nliver inflammation status. Adverse events associated with PEG-IFN-α are \nmanageable in specific HBV populations. PEG-IFN-α is a valuable strategy for a \nfunctional cure in special populations with chronic HBV infection, supporting \nclinical decision-making for HBV management.\n\n© 2025 Zhang et al.\n\nDOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S564254\nPMCID: PMC12649806\nPMID: 41312046 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors report no conflicts of interest in \nthis work."},

Porcine \nendogenous retroviruses (PERVs) pose a special risk for xenotransplantation as \nthese viruses can infect human cells and are integrated in multiple copies in \nthe genome of all pigs and, therefore, they cannot be eliminated as other \nviruses can. To prevent PERV transmission to the recipient, several strategies \nhave been developed: PERV-C-free animals, siRNA and genomic editing. Another \nstrategy is the generation of vaccines based on neutralizing antibodies in order \nto protect the recipient. To investigate whether a protective vaccine is \nfeasible in the case of PERV, the recombinant transmembrane (p15E) and the \nsurface envelope (gp70) protein of PERV were cloned, produced, purified and used \nto immunize rats. For the first time, an adjuvant type that is approved for \nhuman use was used. In all cases we obtained virus binding antibodies as shown \nin Western blot assays and neutralizing antibodies as shown in neutralization \nassays, indicating the potential for a protective vaccine. The epitopes \nrecognized by the antisera against p15E were determined using overlapping \npeptides. Two main epitopes were found in the sequence of p15E, one in the \nmembrane proximal external region (MPER) and one in the fusion peptide proximal \nregion (FPPR). The epitopes correspond to epitopes determined previously when \nimmunizing different animal species with p15E of PERV. Antibodies against these \nepitopes block the conformational changes in the transmembrane envelope proteins \nthat are required for membrane fusion, thereby inhibiting infection. The epitope \nin the MPER is related by sequence and location to an epitope in the \ntransmembrane envelope protein of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) \nrecognized by a broadly neutralizing antibody from infected patients.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/v17111437\nPMCID: PMC12656915\nPMID: 41305460 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest. \nThe funders had no role in the design of the study; in the collection, analyses, \nor interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision \nto publish the results.'},

This study aimed to determine patient characteristics and primary \nreasons for switching to a bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide \n(B/F/TAF) regimen in a large, inner-city cohort of people living with HIV-1 in \nLondon, United Kingdom (UK), and to assess the impact of the 2022 UK National \nProcurement Policy on prescribing patterns. Methods A retrospective review of \nelectronic patient records was conducted for all individuals on antiretroviral \ntherapy (ART) who switched to B/F/TAF at the Royal Free Hospital, London, United \nKingdom. Sociodemographic data, clinical markers including HIV-1 viral load, \nCD4+ T cell count, and previous ART regimen, and the documented reason for the \nswitch were collected. Data were censored on 20 November 2022, allowing for a \ncomparison of switch frequency before and after the implementation of the UK \nNational Procurement for HIV Treatment and Prevention on 1 February 2022. Data \ncollection was completed in the timeframe of 20 November 2022 till 30 June 2023. \nResults The cohort included 386 individuals who switched to B/F/TAF, of whom \n74.1% were male, 25.9% were female, 56% were White, and 27% were \nAfrican/Caribbean, with a median age of 58.5 years. Median duration of living \nwith diagnosed HIV-1 and ART exposure prior to the switch were both 20 years. \nThe most common reason for switching was regimen simplification (n=169, 43.8%), \nfollowed by toxicity (n=115, 29.8%); nearly 10% (n=38, 9.8%) switched due to \nvirological failure. Number of switches increased from 74 in the observed period \nfrom April-November 2021 to 168 between April-November 2022 following the \nimplementation of the National Procurement Policy. Conclusions The primary \nreason for switching to B/F/TAF was the desire for regimen simplification, a \ntrend that appears to have been reinforced by the National Procurement Policy. \nHowever, toxicity, adherence issues, and virological failure were also key \nclinical motivations for switching. These findings highlight the role of B/F/TAF \nin ART optimisation for a diverse and treatment-experienced population of people \nliving with HIV.\n\nCopyright © 2025, Gao et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7759/cureus.95684\nPMCID: PMC12585167\nPMID: 41194834\n\nConflict of interest statement: Human subjects: Informed consent for treatment \nand open access publication was obtained or waived by all participants in this \nstudy.

Most assays developed for screening PR \ninhibitors are in vitro assays, and therefore have several limitations, \nincluding the inability to account for cell permeability, toxicity and the need \nfor compounds activation within cells. The development of cellular reporters \novercoming these limitations is therefore highly desirable. In this study, we \ndeveloped two different Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET)-based \nreporters for Human Immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) PR, allowing the \nsimultaneous monitoring of cell viability and HIV-1 PR activity. The reporters \nemploy two different BRET pairs as donor and acceptor moieties: Renilla \nluciferase (RLuc) with Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP), and Nano luciferase \n(NLuc) with mNeonGreen (mNG), both linked by the HIV-1 p2/p7 cleavage site. \nWhile both reporters specifically detected HIV-1 protease activity, \nmNG-p2/p7-NLuc exhibited higher sensitivity, increased energy transfer and \nbetter spectral separation between donor and acceptor emissions, resulting in a \nsignificantly higher BRET ratio. mNG-p2/p7-NLuc was used to quantify the effect \nof a panel of protease inhibitors in living cells, assessing simultaneously cell \nviability and HIV-1 PR activity. Additionally, it was employed to measure the \npotency of well-known HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Together, these findings demonstrate \nthe utility of the mNG-p2/p7-NLuc reporter as a cell-based tool for the \nevaluation of HIV-1 PR activity and inhibitor efficacy.

Here we explain how to use nextPYP-based methods to \ndetermine the structure and study the conformational heterogeneity of proteins \nusing SP-CET. We provide a step-by-step guide to convert raw tilt-series into \nthree-dimensional structures, following a workflow that includes movie-frame \nalignment, tilt-series alignment, contrast transfer function estimation, \ntomogram reconstruction, particle picking, high-resolution refinement and \nthree-dimensional classification. The advantages of nextPYP are its ease-of-use \nand effectiveness at extracting high-resolution information, which, combined \nwith its storage and compute efficiency, shortens time-to-structure from months \nto days. The complete procedure, including interactive data analysis and \nvisualization, is fully integrated within the application, with no need for \nexternal software. Starting from raw tilt-series data, users will be able to \ndetermine a near-atomic resolution structure of human immunodeficiency virus 1 \nGag protein, eight translational states of Escherichia coli 70S ribosomes and a \nstructure of human 80S ribosomes from plasma-focused ion beam milled HeLa cells. \nThis Protocol is intended as a resource for those who are new to SP-CET as well \nas more experienced users that want to streamline the process of in situ \nstructure determination and heterogeneity analysis using nextPYP.

However, how the virus uses the cell \nmachinery for entry and infection is still a work-in-progress.

This subset of \nimmunological non-responders (INRs) has yet to undergo a comprehensive analysis \nof immunological profiles, and no definitive cytological diagnosis has been \nestablished. In this study, we comparatively analyzed the immunological profiles \nof INRs, immunological responders (IRs), and healthy control individuals (HCs) \nvia single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) \nrepertoire sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and \nidentified a relatively small population of mucosal-associated invariant T \n(MAIT) cells in INRs. This finding was recapitulated in rhesus macaques infected \nwith simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Specifically, the population of the \nnaïve MAIT cell subtype was significantly lower in INRs than in IRs, and the \nmajority of MAIT cells were CD8+ cell subsets. Further characteristic analysis \nof MAIT cells via the transcriptome revealed decreased expression of \ncytotoxicity-related genes in INRs, while displaying increased expression of \ngenes involved in TGF-β receptor signaling. In summary, by conducting a \ncomparative analysis, this study revealed a correlation between the decreased \nproportion of naïve MAIT cells and impaired immune reconstitution in INRs. This \nfinding highlights a particular cell subset that may play a pivotal role in the \nincomplete immune reconstitution, and suggests a plausible cellular target for \nthe modulation of INRs.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Porcine \nendogenous retroviruses (PERVs) pose a special risk for xenotransplantation as \nthese viruses can infect human cells and are integrated in multiple copies in \nthe genome of all pigs and, therefore, they cannot be eliminated as other \nviruses can. To prevent PERV transmission to the recipient, several strategies \nhave been developed: PERV-C-free animals, siRNA and genomic editing. Another \nstrategy is the generation of vaccines based on neutralizing antibodies in order \nto protect the recipient. To investigate whether a protective vaccine is \nfeasible in the case of PERV, the recombinant transmembrane (p15E) and the \nsurface envelope (gp70) protein of PERV were cloned, produced, purified and used \nto immunize rats. For the first time, an adjuvant type that is approved for \nhuman use was used. In all cases we obtained virus binding antibodies as shown \nin Western blot assays and neutralizing antibodies as shown in neutralization \nassays, indicating the potential for a protective vaccine. The epitopes \nrecognized by the antisera against p15E were determined using overlapping \npeptides. Two main epitopes were found in the sequence of p15E, one in the \nmembrane proximal external region (MPER) and one in the fusion peptide proximal \nregion (FPPR). The epitopes correspond to epitopes determined previously when \nimmunizing different animal species with p15E of PERV. Antibodies against these \nepitopes block the conformational changes in the transmembrane envelope proteins \nthat are required for membrane fusion, thereby inhibiting infection. The epitope \nin the MPER is related by sequence and location to an epitope in the \ntransmembrane envelope protein of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) \nrecognized by a broadly neutralizing antibody from infected patients.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/v17111437\nPMCID: PMC12656915\nPMID: 41305460 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest. \nThe funders had no role in the design of the study; in the collection, analyses, \nor interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision \nto publish the results.'},

Vif is used for development of therapeutic agents. \nNatural polymorphisms in Vif can affect its functionality and may be associated \nwith accelerated progression of HIV-infection to the AIDS. The study of Vif \nfeatures in HIV-1 variants circulating in Russia has not been conducted \npreviously.\nTHE AIM OF THE STUDY: to study the genetic diversity of Vif in the HIV-1 \nvariants that circulated in the Moscow region in 2019-2020.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 234 whole blood samples obtained from HIV-infected \npatients without experience of therapy were analyzed. The study design included \nthe following stages: extraction of proviral DNA, amplification of the vif gene, \nsequencing, identification of genetic variants, followed by a study of consensus \nsequences of the most common genetic variants of HIV-1, analysis of the \nconservation and genetic diversity of Vif-A6 (Vif protein of HIV-1 sub-subtype \nA6 variants) in patients with different stages of the disease, and assessment of \ngenetic diversity of Vif-A6 in the Moscow region.\nRESULTS: A high degree of genetic diversity of vif gene was revealed. Consensus \nsequences of Vif in B and CRF63_02A6 variants were obtained for the first time. \nCharacteristic substitutions in the consensus sequences were determined for the \nmost common HIV-1 variants.\nCONCLUSION: The limitation of this study is the small sample of B and \nCRF63_02A6.

To date, natural amino acid \nsubstitutions in Vpr associated with disease progression were identified; the \npossibility of creating therapeutics based on Vpr is being considered. The aim \nof the study is to investigate Vpr features in the most common genetic variants \nof HIV-1 circulating in the Moscow region in 2019-2020.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: HIV-1 samples obtained from 231 patients of the AIDS \nPrevention and Control Center in the period 2019-2020 were studied according to \nthe scheme: proviral DNA extraction, amplification of the vpr gene, sequencing, \nand data analysis. Consensus Vpr sequences of the most common genetic variants \nin Russia and their spatial structures, variability of Vpr variants of HIV-1 \nsub-subtype A6 in patients with different stages of the disease were studied.\nRESULTS: Features of Vpr protein in different genetic variants of HIV-1 could \ninfluence the formation of their oligomeric forms. No sites with statistically \nsignificant differences in the frequency of amino acid substitutions were \nidentified in patients with different stages of disease.\nCONCLUSION: Vpr protein of HIV-1 genetic variants circulating in Russia may have \ndifferences in functional properties. Vpr-A6 variants had low variability in \npatients with different stages of the disease, and therefore Vpr-A6 can be \nconsidered as a target for the development of therapeutic agents.\n\nPublisher: Введение.

К настоящему \nвремени определены естественные аминокислотные замены в Vpr, ассоциированные с \nпрогрессированием заболевания; рассматривается возможность создания средств \nтерапии на основе Vpr. Цель исследования – изучение особенностей Vpr у наиболее \nраспространенных генетических вариантов ВИЧ-1, циркулировавших на территории \nМосковской области в 2019–2020 гг. Материалы и методы.

The rapid change in HIV \ngenomes intricates HIV transmission and progression and attributes HIV \nresistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART). In East Africa, as in other parts of \nthe globe, HIV-1 occurs in various subtypes, circulating recombinant form (CRF) \nand unique recombinant forms, with subtype A1 being the most predominant. \nSurveillance of HIV-1 molecular diversity and drug resistance mutations (DRMs) \nis a linchpin for monitoring viral evolution and treatment efficiency. However, \nconsolidated reports on the same are limited, and therefore, the pursuit of \nmeta-analysis was sought to analyze genetic diversity and drug resistance \npatterns of HIV-1 pol gene and their geographical distributions in four East \nAfrican countries (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Ethiopia). We retrieved 7614 \nHIV-1 pol gene sequences, deposited between 2015 and 2025 from the Los Alamos \nHIV databases. The predominant HIV-1 subtypes were A1 (40.2%), C (21.5%), and D \n(17.7%), with geographical variability. A notable frequency of inter-subtype \nrecombinant was observed with recombinants A1D (9.5%) and A1C (2.94%) being \nprevalent. Few CRFs (> 0.1%) were identified. DRM were present in 42.8% of the \nsequences, with the majority associated with NNRTIs (36.5%) and NRTIs (25.5%). \nThe most frequently associated mutations were K103N and M184V. Although \nresistance to INSTI (3.7%) remained minimal, its presence warrants continued \nmonitoring. A significant association between HIV-1 subtypes and DRM prevalence \nwas observed (χ 2\u2009=\u2009102.43, p < 0.0001), with subtypes showing varied resistance \nburdens. These findings underscore the variability in HIV-1 genetic diversity \nacross studied East African countries, highlighting the need for region-specific \ninterventions, to optimize HIV-1 control in this region.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Aneth Nzinyangwa Kavuraya et al.

These toxins may exceed safe consumption \nlimits and cause adverse health effects in processed potato products. Moreover, \nthe environmental accumulation of these compounds from potato waste and \nbyproducts may disrupt microbial communities and pose risks to aquatics and can \npotentially reintroduce toxins into the food chain. This review explores the \nbiological degradation of α-solanine and α-chaconine, with a focus on microbial \nprocesses mediated by fungi (Plectosphaerella, Gibberella, Aspergillus, \nPenicillium), plant pathogens (Phytophthora infestans) and bacteria \n(Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Glutamicibacter). It highlights key glycosidases such \nas α-rhamnosidase (RhaA), β-glucosidase (GluA), and β-galactosidase (GalA) that \nare involved in deglycosylation and detoxification. A comprehensive review of \nthe literature conducted through PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was \nconducted to analyze relevant studies. Elucidating these degradation processes \nwill help enhance in our understanding of glycoalkaloid deglycosylation and \nprovide valuable insights into the development of effective strategies to \nmitigate glycoalkaloid contamination in food products and reduce the \nenvironmental impact.\n\n© 2025 The Authors.

For intracellular production, a maximum intracellular DAO activity of \n15,404\xa0nkat/Lculture was achieved in fed-batch bioreactor cultivations, while \nfor secretory production, the highest extracellular DAO activity of \n6,078\xa0nkat/Lculture was achieved using the αMF signal peptide without its EAEA \nsequence. The intracellularly produced DAO-GH was partially purified in several \npurification steps with a yield of 80%, a purification factor of about 10 and \nspecific DAO activity of 16.7\xa0nkat/mgprotein. The secretory DAO-GH production \nresulted in a specific DAO activity of 15.4\xa0nkat/mgprotein already in the \ncell-free culture supernatant at the end of cultivation without further \npurification steps. The food industry aims to avoid the use of antimicrobial \nresistance in enzyme production, therefore, a new cassette plasmid with \nself-excisable antibiotic resistance markers was constructed for secretory \nDAO-GH production. The antibiotic-resistance-free K. phaffii clone generated \nwith this plasmid achieved a maximum extracellular DAO activity of \n4,770\xa0nkat/Lculture in a fed-batch bioreactor cultivation. The DAO-GH obtained \nin this cultivation was spray-dried, resulting in a storable powder with \n23\xa0nkat/gpowder DAO activity and a water activity value of 0.12. This study \ndemonstrated the secretion of recombinant DAO in a microbial host such as K. \nphaffii for the first time and provides a strategy for generating \nantibiotic-resistance-free K. phaffii clones.\n\n© 2025.

However, recent reports have documented cases of infections \noccurring after PRP therapy. In this study, we aimed to examine potential \nmicrobial contamination risks associated with PRP therapy and evaluate rapid \nmicrobial detection methods suitable for clinical use.\nMETHODS: We assessed the risk of microbial contamination during blood \ncollection, PRP preparation, and sterility testing. To evaluate suitable \ndetection methods, we compared the microbial detection sensitivities of flow \ncytometry (FCM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identifying microbial \ncontamination in PRP. For this purpose, PRP samples were inoculated with \nStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Cutibacterium acnes, Micrococcus \nspp., Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans.\nRESULTS: Following skin disinfection, microbial colonies were detected at the \nvenipuncture site in six out of ten patients. Environmental monitoring \nidentified airborne microbial colonies in two out of three anonymous PRP \npreparation facilities. Sterility tests revealed negative results for all 85 \nresidual PRP and 15 platelet-poor plasma (PPP) cases. FCM sensitivity for \nmicrobial detection in PRP was effective at a concentration of 102-103 colony \nforming units (cfu)/mL or higher. While C. albicans could not be detected \nseparately from non-specific PRP signals using FCM, it was detectable in PPP at \n≥102\xa0cfu/mL. PCR sensitivity for microbial detection was excellent when \nanalyzing pure microbial suspensions, however, it yielded a high rate of \nfalse-negative and false-positive results when PRP samples contained certain \nmicrobial strains.\nCONCLUSION: The risks of microbial contamination were identified during both \nvenipuncture and PRP production. To reduce these risks, it may be necessary to \nimprove disinfection protocols for venipuncture sites and blood collection \nmethods, implementing appropriate facility-specific measures. Although requiring \nfurther detection sensitivity improvements, FCM is a promising method for \ndetecting viable bacteria in PRP. Given that microbial contamination cannot be \ncompletely eliminated, clinicians providing PRP therapy should remain alert to \nthe potential for postoperative infections and ensure appropriate follow-up \nprotocols are established.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.reth.2025.11.008\nPMCID: PMC12666433\nPMID: 41333320\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare the following financial \ninterests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing \ninterests: Morikuni Tobita reports financial support was provided by AMED. \nYoshitomo Saita reports financial support was provided by AMED.

However, recent reports have documented cases of infections \noccurring after PRP therapy. In this study, we aimed to examine potential \nmicrobial contamination risks associated with PRP therapy and evaluate rapid \nmicrobial detection methods suitable for clinical use.\nMETHODS: We assessed the risk of microbial contamination during blood \ncollection, PRP preparation, and sterility testing. To evaluate suitable \ndetection methods, we compared the microbial detection sensitivities of flow \ncytometry (FCM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identifying microbial \ncontamination in PRP. For this purpose, PRP samples were inoculated with \nStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Cutibacterium acnes, Micrococcus \nspp., Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans.\nRESULTS: Following skin disinfection, microbial colonies were detected at the \nvenipuncture site in six out of ten patients. Environmental monitoring \nidentified airborne microbial colonies in two out of three anonymous PRP \npreparation facilities. Sterility tests revealed negative results for all 85 \nresidual PRP and 15 platelet-poor plasma (PPP) cases. FCM sensitivity for \nmicrobial detection in PRP was effective at a concentration of 102-103 colony \nforming units (cfu)/mL or higher. While C. albicans could not be detected \nseparately from non-specific PRP signals using FCM, it was detectable in PPP at \n≥102\xa0cfu/mL. PCR sensitivity for microbial detection was excellent when \nanalyzing pure microbial suspensions, however, it yielded a high rate of \nfalse-negative and false-positive results when PRP samples contained certain \nmicrobial strains.\nCONCLUSION: The risks of microbial contamination were identified during both \nvenipuncture and PRP production. To reduce these risks, it may be necessary to \nimprove disinfection protocols for venipuncture sites and blood collection \nmethods, implementing appropriate facility-specific measures. Although requiring \nfurther detection sensitivity improvements, FCM is a promising method for \ndetecting viable bacteria in PRP. Given that microbial contamination cannot be \ncompletely eliminated, clinicians providing PRP therapy should remain alert to \nthe potential for postoperative infections and ensure appropriate follow-up \nprotocols are established.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.reth.2025.11.008\nPMCID: PMC12666433\nPMID: 41333320\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare the following financial \ninterests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing \ninterests: Morikuni Tobita reports financial support was provided by AMED. \nYoshitomo Saita reports financial support was provided by AMED.

However, the presence and role \nof intra-articular microbes in osteoarthritis (OA) remain rarely studied. \nSynovial fluid microbiomes of OA patients at different stages are analyzed via \n16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, and the results show that microbial \ndiversity is positively correlated with OA progression, with the microbiomes \ndominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Culturing yields \n145 strains, with Micrococcus luteus (M. luteus)\xa0significantly enriched in \nadvanced OA. In OA rats, intra-articular transplantation of synovial microbes or \nM. luteus G18 exacerbates cartilage damage. Mechanistically, M. luteus G18 \nactivates the TLR2/JNK/AP-1 pathway via surface peptidoglycan, disrupting \nchondrocyte homeostasis to inhibit extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and \npromote degradation. These findings not only provide the first comprehensive \nevidence of the joint cavity microbiota but also unveil M. luteus G18 as a \nmicrobial driver of OA progression. This study reshapes the understanding of OA \npathogenesis and opens new avenues for microbial-based diagnostics and \ntherapeutics-pointing toward a previously overlooked dimension of joint biology \nthat deserves further exploration.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

This study assessed the efficacy of Wright-Giemsa staining in \nremedying bacterial detection failures. We conducted a prospective multicenter \nstudy involving 5667 sputum specimens and 5502 PBCs collected from five distinct \ncenters. When initial Gram staining did not identify bacteria, Wright-Giemsa \nstaining was performed. The study also analyzed cases of missed detections and \nthe undetected microorganism types. Among the sputum specimens, 3.0\xa0% (170 \ncases) that were negative for Gram staining were successfully identified using \nWright-Giemsa staining, revealing 321 previously undetected microbial forms. Of \nthe PBCs, 5.1\xa0% (283 cases) exhibited no microorganisms upon initial Gram \nstaining, and subsequent Wright-Giemsa staining identified bacteria in 119 PBCs \n(42.0\xa0% of the 283 cases). Culture identification further confirmed the \nbacterial presence in 77 PBCs (64.7\xa0% of the 119 cases). The predominant \ncontaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci, Micrococcus spp., \nCorynebacterium spp., and alpha-hemolytic streptococci, which accounted for \n64.9\xa0% of the total isolates. For both specimens, the missed detection rate in \nprimary hospitals was significantly higher than in regional central hospitals \n(p\xa0<\xa00.001). Incorporating Wright-Giemsa staining can substantially decrease the \nmissed detection rate in bacterial smears, potentially harmonizing \ninter-laboratory discrepancies. For Gram-staining-negative sputum specimens or \nPBCs, Wright-Giemsa staining may enhances detection in microbiology \nlaboratories, particularly in primary hospitals with limited specimens or \ndiagnostic experience.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

This study quantified \nbioaerosol concentrations during bronchoscopy to evaluate occupational exposure.\nMETHODOLOGY: Aerosol samples were collected during routine bronchoscopies in two \nhospitals using personal samplers with quartz filters attached to healthcare \nprofessional's clothing. Samples were cultured on various media, with bacterial \ncolonies identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and fungal colonies by ITS1-2 region \nsequencing. Respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, RSV) were detected \nvia RT-PCR.\nRESULTS: A total of 44 aerosol samples were collected: 7 pre-procedure, 32 \nduring bronchoscopy, and 5 between patients. From samples taken during \nbronchoscopies, 287 microbial colonies were isolated. The most abundant \nbacterial genera were Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Bacillus, while fungal \ngenera included Aspergillus, Talaromyces and Cladosporium. Several potentially \npathogenic species were identified, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Kocuria \nrosea, and Kroppenstedtia pulmonis, as well as some pathogenic fungi. A total of \n8 previously unsuspected SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were also detected. Our \nestimates suggest that an interventionalist, without protective equipment, could \nbe exposed to approximately 98.94 CFU/m3 during a typical procedure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopy generates aerosols containing microorganisms from the \noral, nasal, and pulmonary microbiota, as well as potential pathogens. These \naerosols can be inhaled by healthcare workers, representing a risk of \noccupational infection.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

In this study, we functionally characterized a novel chimera-type \ngalectin-3 homolog from largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), designated \nMsGal-3B. The open reading frame of MsGal-3B encodes a 258-amino acid protein \ncontaining a canonical carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and an N-terminal \nnon-lectin region, typical of galectin-3 family members. Phylogenetic analysis \nrevealed that MsGal-3B clusters with galectin-3 orthologs from Perciformes, \nsuggesting functional conservation within this order. Recombinant MsGal-3B \n(rMsGal-3B) exhibited strong affinity for peptidoglycan (PGN) and β-glucan \n(GLU), and weak interaction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Microbial binding \nassays revealed broad recognition across Gram-positive bacteria (Micrococcus \nluteus, Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas veronii, \nVibrio parahaemolyticus), and fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris). \nNotably, rMsGal-3B selectively agglutinated Escherichia coli and M. luteus, but \nnot A. veronii or S. cerevisiae, indicating ligand-dependent functional \nspecificity. rMsGal-3B significantly suppressed the proliferation of E. coli, M. \nluteus, and S. cerevisiae, while showing no inhibitory effect on A. veronii, \nsuggesting a narrow-spectrum antimicrobial profile. Additionally, rMsGal-3B \nexhibited hemagglutination activity, implying a potential role in host cell \nrecognition or immune modulation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that \nMsGal-3B functions as a multifunctional immune effector in M. salmoides, capable \nof selective microbial recognition, agglutination, and targeted antimicrobial \nactivity. This study provides new insights into the role of teleost galectins in \ninnate immunity and highlights their potential as molecular targets for disease \ncontrol in aquaculture.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Tick samples were collected from the domesticated animals from the \nPatiala, Ropar, and Mohali districts of Punjab, India from February 2022- April \n2022. DNA was extracted, and the library was prepared by targeting the V3-V4 \nhypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The sequencing was conducted in \nIllumina using the 300\u202fbp paired-end chemistry. Eight tick samples were analyzed \nfrom the Patiala, Ropar and Mohali districts of Punjab, India, revealing a \ndiverse range of bacterial species within the tick microbiome. Seven out of \neight samples were found to harbour Coxiella-like bacteria (46-181,607 reads; \nclosely related to C. burnetii based on 16S rRNA [V3-V4] sequence similarity), \nindicating their abundance in the tick population. Furthermore, the analysis \nuncovered the presence of other pathogenic bacterial genera, including \nStaphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, \nBordetella, and Micrococcus in the tick microbiome, highlighting the abundance \nand diversity of infectious organisms within ticks. 16S rRNA gene-based \nmetagenomics enables valuable insights into infectious agents in \ndisease-transmitting vectors. Coxiella-like bacteria were found to be \npredominant bacterial species in the tick microbiomes in this study. The public \nhealth significance of this finding in animals and humans needs to be explored \nin this region. However, as 16S rRNA sequencing offers limited resolution for \ndistinguishing closely related taxa, further confirmation using additional loci \nor whole-genome sequencing is warranted.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

However, serological cross-reactivity \namong these viruses poses significant diagnostic challenges, potentially leading \nto misclassification, inappropriate management, and unreliable epidemiological \ndata. To review the immunological mechanisms contributing to serological \ncross-reactivity in AVH and highlight the diagnostic and clinical implications, \nwith a focus on the importance of molecular confirmation. A structured \nliterature review was conducted using the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of \nScience databases. Keywords included terms related to cross-reactivity, acute \nhepatitis, serological testing, molecular diagnostics, and specific viral \nagents. Peer-reviewed studies published in English up to 2025 were included. \nCross-reactivity in AVH is primarily driven by polyclonal B-cell activation, \nantibody polyreactivity, and T-cell receptor cross-specificity. Studies report \nthat up to 33.3% of anti-HEV IgM-positive samples also test positive for EBV or \nCMV IgM, despite negative PCR confirmation. This overlap is particularly \nproblematic in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women, where accurate \npathogen identification is critical. While PCR offers superior specificity and \nsensitivity, its implementation is limited by cost and accessibility in \nlow-resource settings. Serological cross-reactivity in acute hepatitis \nsignificantly impacts diagnostic precision and clinical decision-making. \nIncorporating molecular testing, especially PCR, into diagnostic workflows is \nessential to ensure accurate diagnosis, particularly in high-risk populations.\n\n© 2025.

The absence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) on the biopsy is also a \ndesirable criterion, leading to the differential diagnosis of EBV-positive \nDLBCL.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) \ninfection has been epidemiologically associated with SLE, yet its role in \npathogenesis remains incompletely defined. Here, we developed an EBV-specific \nsingle-cell RNA-sequencing platform and used it to demonstrate that EBV \ninfection reprograms autoreactive antinuclear antigen B cells to drive \nautoimmunity in SLE. We demonstrated that, in SLE, EBV+ B cells are \npredominantly CD27+CD21low memory B cells that are present at increased \nfrequencies and express ZEB2, TBX21 (T-bet), and antigen-presenting cell \ntranscriptional pathways. Integrative analysis of chromatin immunoprecipitation \nsequencing (ChIP-seq), assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing \n(ATAC-seq), and RNA polymerase II occupancy data revealed EBV nuclear antigen 2 \n(EBNA2) binding at the transcriptional start sites and regulatory regions \nof\xa0CD27,\xa0ZEB2, and TBX21, as well as the antigen-presenting cell genes \ndemonstrated to be up-regulated in SLE EBV+ B cells. We expressed recombinant \nantibodies from SLE EBV+ B cells and demonstrated that they bind prototypical \nSLE nuclear autoantigens, whereas those from healthy individuals do not. We \nfurther found that SLE EBV+ B cells can serve as antigen-presenting cells to \ndrive activation of T peripheral helper cells with concomitant activation of \nrelated EBV- antinuclear double-negative 2 B cells and plasmablasts. Our results \nprovide a mechanistic basis for EBV being a driver of SLE through infecting and \nreprogramming nuclear antigen-reactive B cells to become activated \nantigen-presenting cells with the potential to promote systemic disease-driving \nautoimmune responses.\n\nDOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.ady0210\nPMID: 41223250 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'},

The latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) gene, known \nfor its high heterogeneity, plays a crucial role in the oncogenic potential of \nEBV associated NPC (EBVaNPC).\xa0This study aimed to integrate algorithm with \nexperimental validation to contribute valuable insights into the early detection \nand risk assessment of EBVaNPC, and investigate the functional significance of \nLMP1 key mutation. The LMP1 region in clinical EBV-positive subjects was \nsequenced with amplicon-based next-generation sequencing. An automatic viral \nsequence feature extraction (ViSFE) approach was developed. Biological \nimplications of predicted key mutation on tumor cell biological behaviors were \ninvestigated through qRT-PCR, EdU analysis, transwell invasion assay, RNA \nsequencing and gene ontology fingerprint (GOF) method. Validation results \ndemonstrate the feasibility of ViSFE applied to nucleotide data of varying \nlengths. Our study identified H101R mutation in LMP1 as a top feature, confirmed \nby proliferation and invasion experiments. By integrating EBVaNPC GOF and RNA \nsequencing data, the differentially expressed genes linked to the H101R mutation \nwere primarily involved in immune regulation processes. Both approaches \nindicated a notable association between FOXP3-T cell anergy and WNT7A-stem cell \npopulation maintenance in HNE-1MUT-LMP1.

We further conducted experiments in \nEBV-positive B-cell lines to examine mechanisms.ResultsGenetically proxied \nsmoking initiation and lifetime smoking were associated with higher odds of \nanti-EBV IgG seropositivity, whereas an older age at smoking initiation was \nassociated with lower odds. No consistent associations were observed for sleep \ntraits; dietary findings were heterogeneous across discovery and replication \ncohorts. In vitro, nicotine increased EBV-DNA levels and up-regulated lytic \ngenes (BZLF1, BRLF1) and gp350, with concordant increases in BZLF1 and EA-D \nproteins; these effects coincided with ROS accumulation and were attenuated by \nthe ROS scavenger NAC.ConclusionsOur findings support that smoking is associated \nwith EBV seropositivity and nicotine-induced oxidative stress as a plausible \nmechanism.

In previous studies, we identified \nelevated IgG responses to arginine-rich (poly-R) sequences within the EBV \nnuclear antigens EBNA4 and EBNA6 in post-infectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS). Building \non these findings, this exploratory study examines IgG reactivity to \npoly-R-containing EBV-derived peptides and homologous human peptides in women \nwith PCS and ME/CFS.\nMETHODS: IgG reactivity to poly-R containing peptides derived from EBNA4 and \nEBNA6, and homologous human 15-mer peptides and the corresponding full-length \nproteins, was assessed using a cytometric bead array (CBA) and a multiplex \ndot-blot assay. Serum samples were analyzed from 45 female PCS patients \ndiagnosed according to WHO criteria, including 26 who also met the Canadian \nConsensus criteria for ME/CFS (pcME/CFS), 36 female patients with non-COVID \npost-infectious ME/CFS (piME/CFS), and 34 female healthy controls (HC).\nRESULTS: Autoantibodies targeting poly-R peptide sequences of the neuronal \nantigen SRRM3, the ion channel SLC24A3, TGF-β signaling regulator TSPLY2, and \nthe angiogenesis-related protein TSPYL5, as well as full-length α-adrenergic \nreceptor (ADRA) proteins, were more frequently detected in patient groups. \nSeveral of these autoantibodies showed positive correlations with core symptoms, \nincluding autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and pain.\nCONCLUSION: This exploratory study identify autoantibodies directed against EBV \nmimicking arginine-rich sequences in human proteins, suggesting a potential role \nfor molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of PCS and ME/CFS.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Hoheisel, Fleischer, Rubarth, Sepúlveda, Bauer, Konietschke, \nKedor Peters, Stein, Wittke, Seifert, Bellmann-Strobl, Mautner, Behrends, \nScheibenbogen and Sotzny.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1650948\nPMCID: PMC12491002\nPMID: 41050647 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."},

Members of \nthis genus are the inhabitants of both natural and artificial thermal \nenvironments. We performed phylogenomic analyses and comparative genomic studies \nto unravel the genomic diversity among the strains belonging to the genus \nThermus in geographically different thermal springs. Sixteen Thermus strains \nwere isolated and sequenced from hot springs, Qucai hot springs in Tibet and \nTengchong hot springs in Yunnan, China. 16S rRNA gene based phylogeny and \nphylogenomic analyses based on concatenated set of 971 Orthologous Protein \nFamilies (supermatrix and gene content methods) revealed a mixed distribution of \nthe Thermus strains. Whole genome based phylogenetic analysis showed, all 16 \nThermus strains belong to five species; Thermus oshimai (YIM QC-2-109, YIM 1640, \nYIM 1627, 77359, 77923, 77838), Thermus antranikianii (YIM 73052, 77412, 77311, \n71206), Thermus brokianus (YIM 73518, 71318, 72351), Thermus hydrothermalis (YIM \n730264 and 77927) and one potential novel species 77420 forming clade with \nThermus thalpophilus SYSU G00506T. Although the genomes of different strains of \nThermus of same species were highly similar in their metabolic pathways, but \nsubtle differences were found. CRISPR loci were detected through genome-wide \nscreening, which showed that Thermus isolates from two different thermal \nlocations had well developed defense system against viruses and adopt similar \nstrategy for survival. Additionally, comparative genome analysis screened \ncompetence loci across all the Thermus genomes which could be helpful to acquire \nDNA from environment. In the present study it was found that Thermus isolates \nuse two mechanism of incomplete denitrification pathway, some Thermus strains \nproduces nitric oxide while others nitrious oxide (dinitrogen oxide), which show \nthe heterotrophic lifestyle of Thermus genus. All isolated organisms encoded \ncomplete pathways for glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid and pentose phosphate. \nCalvin Benson Bassham cycle genes were identified in genomes of T. oshimai and \nT. antranikianii strains, while genomes of all T. brokianus strains and organism \n77420 were lacking. Arsenic, cadmium and cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistant genes \nwere detected in genomes of all sequenced Thermus strains. Strains 77,420, \n77,311, 73,518, 77,412 and 72,351 genomes were found harboring genes for \nsiderophores production. Sox gene clusters were identified in all sequenced \ngenomes, except strain YIM 730264, suggesting a mode of \nchemolithotrophy.\xa0Through the comparative genomic analysis, we also identified \n77420 as the genome type species and its validity as novel organism was \nconfirmed by whole genome sequences comparison. Although isolate 77420 had 99.0% \n16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with T. thalpophilus SYSU G00506T but based on \nANI 95.86% (Jspecies) and digital DDH 68.80% (GGDC) values differentiate it as a \npotential novel species. Similarly, in the phylogenomic tree, the novel isolate \n77,420 forming a separate branch with their closest reference type strain T. \nthalpophilus SYSU G00506T.\n\n© 2024.

However, \nthe denitrification abilities of the genus as a whole remain poorly \ncharacterized. Here, we describe diverse denitrification phenotypes and \ngenotypes of a collection of 24 strains representing ten species, all isolated \nfrom a variety of geothermal systems in China. Confirmed terminal products of \nnitrate reduction were nitrite or N2O, while nitric oxide (NO) was inferred as \nthe terminal product in some strains. Most strains produced N2O; complete \ndenitrification was not observed. Denitrification phenotypes were largely \nconsistent with the presence of denitrification genes, and strains of the same \nspecies often had the same denitrification phenotypes and largely syntenous \ndenitrification gene clusters. Genes for nirS and nirK coexisted in three \nThermus brockianus and three Thermus oshimai genomes, which is a unique hallmark \nof some denitrifying Thermus strains and may be ecologically important. These \nresults show that incomplete denitrification phenotypes are prominent, but \nvariable, within and between Thermus species. The incomplete denitrification \nphenotypes described here suggest Thermus species may play important roles in \nconsortial denitrification in high-temperature terrestrial biotopes where \nsufficient supply of oxidized inorganic nitrogen exists.\n\n© 2022.

Based on conserved domain \nanalyses and metabolic pathway mapping, the cluster was classified into upper- \nand peripheral-pathway operons. The upper-pathway genes, responsible for the \ndegradation of p-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate, are located on a 0.27-Mb \nplasmid, whereas the peripheral-pathway genes, responsible for the \ntransformation of ferulate, are spread throughout the plasmid and the \nchromosome. In addition, a lower-pathway operon was also identified in the \nplasmid that corresponds to the meta-cleavage pathway of catechol. \nSpectrophotometric and gene induction data suggest that the upper and lower \noperons are induced by p-hydroxybenzoate, which the strain can degrade \ncompletely within 4\u2009days of incubation, whereas the peripheral genes are \nexpressed constitutively. The upper degradation pathway follows a less common \nroute, proceeding via the decarboxylation of protocatechuate to form catechol, \nand involves a novel thermostable γ-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase homolog, \nidentified as protocatechuate decarboxylase based on gene deletion experiments. \nThis gene cluster is conserved in only a few members of the Thermales and shows \ntraces of vertical expansion of catabolic pathways in these organisms toward \nlignoaromatics.IMPORTANCE High-temperature steam treatment of lignocellulosic \nbiomass during the extraction of cellulose and hemicellulose fractions leads to \nthe release of a wide array of lignin-derived aromatics into the natural \necosystem, some of which can have detrimental effects on the environment. Not \nonly will identifying organisms capable of using such aromatics aid in \nenvironmental cleanup, but thermostable enzymes, if characterized, can also be \nused for efficient lignin valorization. However, no thermophilic lignin \ndegraders have been reported thus far. The present study reports T. oshimai JL-2 \nas a thermophilic bacterium with the potential to use lignin-derived aromatics. \nThe identification of a novel thermostable protocatechuate decarboxylase gene in \nthe strain further adds to its significance, as such an enzyme can be \nefficiently used in the biosynthesis of cis,cis-muconate, an important \nintermediate in the commercial production of plastics.\n\nCopyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/AEM.01589-20\nPMCID: PMC8208148\nPMID: 33741620 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'},

Comparison of the T. thermophilus \nJL-18 chromosome with those from other strains of T. thermophilus revealed a \nhigh degree of synteny, whereas the megaplasmids from the same strains were \nhighly plastic. The T. oshimai JL-2 chromosome and megaplasmids shared little or \nno synteny with other sequenced Thermus strains. Phylogenomic analyses using a \nconcatenated set of conserved proteins confirmed the phylogenetic and taxonomic \nassignments based on 16S rRNA phylogenetics. Both chromosomes encode a complete \nglycolysis, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and pentose phosphate pathway plus \nglucosidases, glycosidases, proteases, and peptidases, highlighting highly \nversatile heterotrophic capabilities. Megaplasmids of both strains contained a \ngene cluster encoding enzymes predicted to catalyze the sequential reduction of \nnitrate to nitrous oxide; however, the nitrous oxide reductase required for the \nterminal step in denitrification was absent, consistent with their incomplete \ndenitrification phenotypes. A sox gene cluster was identified in both \nchromosomes, suggesting a mode of chemolithotrophy. In addition, nrf and psr \ngene clusters in T. oshmai JL-2 suggest respiratory nitrite ammonification and \npolysulfide reduction as possible modes of anaerobic respiration.\n\nDOI: 10.4056/sigs.3667269\nPMCID: PMC3764938\nPMID: 24019992'},

While DNA ADP-ribosyltransferase (DarT2) \ntoxin mono-ADP-ribosylates a single-stranded DNA sequence motif and potentially \ninduces bacterial dormancy, DNA ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase (DarG) antitoxin, \ncontaining a highly conserved macrodomain, reverses the modification and \nrestores bacterial growth. Therefore, developing DarG-selective inhibitors may \nrepresent a promising strategy to combat tuberculosis. However, no \nsmall-molecule inhibitors targeting DarG have been identified. Here, we \ndeveloped and optimized a simple and robust fluorescence resonance energy \ntransfer (FRET)-based binding assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors \ntargeting the DarG macrodomain. The assay utilized fluorescent fusion proteins \nto detect the interaction between the DarG macrodomain and an ADP-ribosylated \npeptide.

The genome of the virus is enclosed in an icosahedral capsid. This \ncapsid is made of the small major capsid protein (VP16), the large major capsid \nprotein (VP17), and the minor capsid protein (VP11). In addition to these three \nstructural proteins, membrane-associated proteins (VP15, VP19, VP20, VP22, and \nVP23) have been identified in the virus and may serve as scaffold proteins to \nhelp with viral assembly. Previous studies have expressed VP11, VP16, and VP17 \nin E. coli. A mixture of these proteins can lead to the formation of complexes. \nHowever, the potential to express membrane-associated proteins has never been \nexplored. Here, we demonstrated, for the first time, the expression and \nco-expression of some membrane-associated proteins with capsid (coat) proteins, \nboth in the natural host and in E. coli. Co-expression of these proteins did not \nresult in the assembly of virus-like particles. We explored further strategies \nto express and purify some of the proteins for future studies. We observed that \nthe insertion of a purification tag (Strep-II tag, but not a histidine tag) \nsignificantly reduced the expression levels of some of the proteins. Six of the \neight structural proteins were successfully purified to homogeneity using \ndifferent approaches. We showed that VP20 and VP22 migrated on SDS PAGE gel at \nsizes larger than their predicted molecular weights.

This study successfully enriched thermophilic \nsulfide-oxidizing denitrifiers from hot spring sediments (60\xa0°C) in an expanded \ngranular sludge bed (EGSB) reactor, achieving a stable nitrate removal rate of \n250\xa0mg N L-1 d-1. This thermal system demonstrated a higher tolerance threshold \nfor sulfides (250\xa0mg TDS L-1) than mesophilic processes. The influent \nsulfide-to-nitrate (S/N) molar ratio critically influenced nitrogen removal \nefficiency with nitrite accumulation at low S/N ratios (1:1), whereas higher \nratios (2:1) restored complete nitrate reduction. Microbial community analysis \ndemonstrated Thermus (52.89\xa0%) as the predominant genus in the SDAD system, \nmarking the first report of its dominance in thermophilic nitrogen-sulfur \ncoupling, alongside uc_Aquificales (21.78\xa0%).

Strikingly, Thermus scotoductus \nencoded nrfH, and it might be the overlooked " nitrogen retainer" in geothermal \necosystems. This work elucidates the cooperative and competitive interactions \nbetween thermophilic denitrifiers, and establishes a multi-level thermal \nadaptability analysis.

Transketolase can also \nrecognize non-phosphorylated monosaccharides as substrates, to form \nnon-phosphorylated 7-carbon ketoses (heptuloses). In nature, monosaccharides are \nusually composed of 3-6 carbons, and higher carbon sugars composed of 7 or more \ncarbons are rare. The higher carbon sugars may exhibit unknown, interesting \nbioactivity, and a method for their mass production should be established. \nTransketolase can form a C-C covalent bond, and is expected to show marked \npotential as a biocatalyst to synthesize higher carbon sugars. We carried out \ndeterminations of the optimal pH and temperature on enzyme activity, and X-ray \nstructure determination of Thermus thermophilus HB8 transketolase (TtTK), and \nrevealed that TtTK can efficiently synthesize four heptuloses: d-sedoheptulose, \nl-glucoheptulose, d-idoheptulose, and l-galactoheptulose, from lithium \nhydroxypyruvate and non-phosphorylated aldopentoses, d-ribose, l-arabinose, \nd-xylose, and l-lyxose, respectively. Transketolase is stereospecific and \nenantioselective to hydroxyaldehydes substrates (Cn) with an (2R) configuration \nresulting in the formation of d-threo (3S,4R) Cn+\xa02 ketoses. Pseudomonas \ncichoriid-tagatose 3-epimerase (PcDTE) is a ketose 3-epimerase with a broad \nsubstrate specificity, and it was used for the production of a rare sugar, \nd-allulose from d-fructose (conversion rate: 25\xa0%, purity: 99.5\xa0%). We also \nclarified that PcDTE can successfully catalyze the epimerization at the \n3-position of the four heptuloses obtained by TtTK, to give the four C3-epimers: \nd-alloheptulose, l-mannoheptulose, d-guloheptulose, and l-taloheptulose.

While microbial community \ncomposition and succession have been previously described during HTC, the \nmetabolic activity and adaptation of thermophilic microbiomes remain largely \nunexplored. In this study, we conducted time-series metagenomic and \nmetatranscriptomic analyses on samples from a full-scale HTC system to \ncharacterize the composition, functional potential, and metabolic activity of \nthermophilic bacteria. A total of 227 non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes \n(MAGs) were recovered, including 45 thermophilic MAGs (optimal growth \ntemperatures > 45°C). Metatranscriptomic profiling revealed that thermophilic \ntaxa-such as Thermus thermophilus, Planifilum fulgidum, and Thermaerobacter \nspp.-were highly transcriptionally active and played vital roles in heat \ngeneration through the upregulation of energy production and carbohydrate \nmetabolism pathways. Additionally, these thermophiles exhibited survival and \nadaptation strategies involving physiological changes (e.g., spore formation, \nenhanced motility, and genome streamlining) and the induction of thermal \nresistance mechanisms (e.g., DNA repair systems, heat-shock proteins, and \nsynthesis of compatible solutes). Overall, this study provides novel insights \ninto the diverse survival strategies of thermophilic microbiomes in HTC and \nsuggests potential avenues for optimizing thermophilic biotreatment processes \nfor solid waste management.\nIMPORTANCE: Despite increasing interest in hyperthermophilic composting as a \nsustainable waste treatment strategy, the mechanisms by which microbial \ncommunities both tolerate and drive extreme thermal conditions remain unclear. \nThis study fills a critical knowledge gap by identifying a small group of highly \nactive thermophilic bacteria that dominate during peak composting temperatures \nand orchestrate endogenous heat production. Using genome-resolved multi-omics, \nwe demonstrate that these thermophiles couple high metabolic output with \nspecialized survival strategies-such as genome streamlining, thermotolerance \nsystems, and adaptive motility systems. These findings advance our understanding \nof microbial function under extreme conditions and provide a framework for \noptimizing thermophilic microbiome performance in engineered ecosystems.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/msystems.00956-25\nPMCID: PMC12625702\nPMID: 41128541 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'},

This study \nconducted a systematic cross-species comparative analysis of milk from 15 \nmammalian species using 16S rRNA sequencing and GC-MS techniques. The results \nrevealed a conserved core microbiota at the phylum level, primarily composed of \nFirmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, while at the genus level, \nPseudomonas, Lactobacillus, and Propionibacterium were predominant. Host \nphysiological traits and ecological environment were identified as key drivers \nof milk microbial composition.

Significant differences were observed in the SCFA profiles among milk \nfrom different species. Human milk exhibited high levels of butyric acid \n(12.94\xa0±\xa07.63\xa0μg/mL), valeric acid (0.12\xa0±\xa00.07\xa0μg/mL), and caproic acid \n(11.08\xa0±\xa05.82\xa0μg/mL).

Despite intense research efforts and prior \nevidence of a rather widespread phylogenetic occurrence of the related genetic \nmachinery, reports on extreme thermophilic and hyperthermophilic \npolyhydroxyalkanoates producers remain scarce. However, thermophilic cell \nfactories for bioplastic production would serve as an excellent example of \nNext-Generation Industrial Biotechnology. In this study, we aim to address this \nresearch gap by establishing a bioinformatics pipeline to mine genomes of \nextremely and moderately thermophilic microorganisms for signatures of potential \npolyhydroxyalkanoate production. Based on a collection of verified protein \nsequences of polyhydroxyalkanoate polymerase PhaC, the key biosynthetic enzyme, \ncarefully curated sets of thermophilic bacterial and archaeal genomes were \nscreened. This revealed that although PhaC-encoding genes are prevalent in \ndiverse moderately thermophilic bacteria, they are absent in the considered \nextreme thermophilic bacteria. In contrast, a few limited examples of extreme \nthermophilic archaea were found to encode putative phaC genes embedded within a \ntypical polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis operon in their genomes, namely within \nthe genera Ferroglobus, Geoglobus and Archaeoglobus, while no hits were found in \nextreme thermophilic bacteria. The latter included Thermus thermophilus, which \nwas previously reported as a polyhydroxyalkanoates producer. In this study, \nusing various extraction and analytical methods, no evidence of \npolyhydroxyalkanoate production was found under the tested conditions. Based on \nthe findings in this study, we conclude that polyhydroxyalkanoate production is \nvery scarce in extreme thermophiles and hyperthermophiles, for reasons that \nremain to be elucidated.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

While DNA ADP-ribosyltransferase (DarT2) \ntoxin mono-ADP-ribosylates a single-stranded DNA sequence motif and potentially \ninduces bacterial dormancy, DNA ADP-ribosylglycohydrolase (DarG) antitoxin, \ncontaining a highly conserved macrodomain, reverses the modification and \nrestores bacterial growth. Therefore, developing DarG-selective inhibitors may \nrepresent a promising strategy to combat tuberculosis. However, no \nsmall-molecule inhibitors targeting DarG have been identified. Here, we \ndeveloped and optimized a simple and robust fluorescence resonance energy \ntransfer (FRET)-based binding assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors \ntargeting the DarG macrodomain. The assay utilized fluorescent fusion proteins \nto detect the interaction between the DarG macrodomain and an ADP-ribosylated \npeptide. Screening the target-focused phenotypic library using this method led \nto the identification of pranlukast, which selectively inhibited the DNA \nADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of M. tuberculosis DarG and its bacterial \northologues, including Thermus aquaticus DarG and SCO6735 in Streptomyces \ncoelicolor. Notably, pranlukast did not inhibit human macrodomains, indicating \nstrong selectivity for bacterial targets. Since pranlukast has previously been \nreported to reduce M. tuberculosis burden, further investigation into its action \nmechanism in this context would be valuable.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.5c00695\nPMID: 41167975 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'},

While microbial community \ncomposition and succession have been previously described during HTC, the \nmetabolic activity and adaptation of thermophilic microbiomes remain largely \nunexplored. In this study, we conducted time-series metagenomic and \nmetatranscriptomic analyses on samples from a full-scale HTC system to \ncharacterize the composition, functional potential, and metabolic activity of \nthermophilic bacteria. A total of 227 non-redundant metagenome-assembled genomes \n(MAGs) were recovered, including 45 thermophilic MAGs (optimal growth \ntemperatures > 45°C). Metatranscriptomic profiling revealed that thermophilic \ntaxa-such as Thermus thermophilus, Planifilum fulgidum, and Thermaerobacter \nspp.-were highly transcriptionally active and played vital roles in heat \ngeneration through the upregulation of energy production and carbohydrate \nmetabolism pathways. Additionally, these thermophiles exhibited survival and \nadaptation strategies involving physiological changes (e.g., spore formation, \nenhanced motility, and genome streamlining) and the induction of thermal \nresistance mechanisms (e.g., DNA repair systems, heat-shock proteins, and \nsynthesis of compatible solutes). Overall, this study provides novel insights \ninto the diverse survival strategies of thermophilic microbiomes in HTC and \nsuggests potential avenues for optimizing thermophilic biotreatment processes \nfor solid waste management.\nIMPORTANCE: Despite increasing interest in hyperthermophilic composting as a \nsustainable waste treatment strategy, the mechanisms by which microbial \ncommunities both tolerate and drive extreme thermal conditions remain unclear. \nThis study fills a critical knowledge gap by identifying a small group of highly \nactive thermophilic bacteria that dominate during peak composting temperatures \nand orchestrate endogenous heat production. Using genome-resolved multi-omics, \nwe demonstrate that these thermophiles couple high metabolic output with \nspecialized survival strategies-such as genome streamlining, thermotolerance \nsystems, and adaptive motility systems. These findings advance our understanding \nof microbial function under extreme conditions and provide a framework for \noptimizing thermophilic microbiome performance in engineered ecosystems.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/msystems.00956-25\nPMCID: PMC12625702\nPMID: 41128541 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'},

Studies of \nmesophilic Alcaligenes xylosoxidans cytochrome c'-α (AxCP-α) have revealed an \nunusual NO-binding mechanism involving both heme faces, in which NO first binds \nto form a distal hexa-coordinate Fe(II)-NO (6cNO) intermediate and then \ndisplaces the proximal His to form a proximal penta-coordinate Fe(II)-NO (5cNO) \nfinal product. Here, we characterize a thermally stable cytochrome c'-α from \nthermophilic Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus (PhCP-α) to understand how protein \nthermal stability affects NO binding. Electron paramagnetic and resonance Raman \nspectroscopies reveal the formation of a PhCP-α 5cNO product, with time-resolved \n(stopped-flow) UV-vis absorbance indicating the involvement of a 6cNO \nintermediate. Relative to AxCP-α, the rates of 6cNO and 5cNO formation in PhCP-α \nare ∼11- and ∼13-fold lower, respectively. Notably, x-ray crystal structures of \nPhCP-α in the presence and absence of NO suggest that the sluggish formation of \nthe proximal 5cNO product results from conformational rigidity: the Arg-132 \nresidue (adjacent to the proximal His ligand) is held in place by a salt bridge \nbetween Arg-75 and Glu-135 (an interaction not present in AxCP-α or a \npsychrophilic counterpart). Overall, our data provide fresh insights into \nstructural factors controlling NO binding in heme proteins, including 5cNO \ncomplexes relevant to eukaryotic NO sensors.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Biophysical Society.

In this study we investigate the \nmicrobial populations from the deep [up to 2,908 meters below surface (mbs)] \ngranitic rocks within the Koyna seismogenic zone, reactivated (enriched) under \nanaerobic, high temperature (50°C), chemolithoautotrophic conditions. Subsurface \nrock samples from six different depths (1,679-2,908 mbs) are incubated \n(180\u2009days) with CO2 (+H2) or HCO3 - as the sole C source. Estimation of total \nprotein, ATP, utilization of NO3 - and SO4 2- and 16S rRNA gene qPCR suggests \nconsiderable microbial growth within the chemolithotrophic conditions. We note a \nbetter response of rock hosted community towards CO2 (+H2) over HCO3 -. 16S rRNA \ngene amplicon sequencing shows a depth-wide distribution of diverse \nchemolithotrophic (and a few fermentative) Bacteria and Archaea. Comamonas, \nBurkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, Ralstonia, Klebsiella, unclassified \nBurkholderiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae are reactivated as dominant organisms \nfrom the enrichments of the deeper rocks (2335-2,908 mbs) with both CO2 and HCO3 \n-. For the rock samples from shallower depths, organisms of varied taxa are \nenriched under CO2 (+H2) and HCO3 -. Pseudomonas, Rhodanobacter, \nMethyloversatilis, and Thaumarchaeota are major CO2 (+H2) utilizers, while \nNocardioides, Sphingomonas, Aeromonas, respond towards HCO3 -. H2 oxidizing \nCupriavidus, Hydrogenophilus, Hydrogenophaga, CO2 fixing Cyanobacteria \nRhodobacter, Clostridium, Desulfovibrio and methanogenic archaea are also \nenriched. Enriched chemolithoautotrophic members show good correlation with CO2, \nCH4 and H2 concentrations of the native rock environments, while the organisms \nfrom upper horizons correlate more to NO3 -, SO4 2- , Fe and TIC levels of the \nrocks. Co-occurrence networks suggest close interaction between \nchemolithoautotrophic and chemoorganotrophic/fermentative organisms. Carbon \nfixing 3-HP and DC/HB cycles, hydrogen, sulfur oxidation, CH4 and acetate \nmetabolisms are predicted in the enriched communities. Our study elucidates the \npresence of live, C and H2 utilizing Bacteria and Archaea in deep subsurface \ngranitic rocks, which are enriched successfully. Significant impact of depth and \ngeochemical controls on relative distribution of various chemolithotrophic \nspecies enriched and their C and H2 metabolism are highlighted.

While the microbiota \nplays a key role in EBS formation, the specific microbial features remain poorly \nunderstood. The aim of the study was to explore the microbial characteristics of \nchildren aged 3-5 years with the EBS.\nMETHODS: EBS (30) and healthy (30) supragingiva plaque samples were collected \nfor comparative analysis. The microbial features of the 2 groups were \ninvestigated using Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology and verified by \nquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Potential EBS-dominant genera \nwere isolated and identified, followed by whole-genome sequencing and \nbio-informatic analysis.\nRESULTS: The qPCR results verified that Abiotrophia, Lautropia and Arachnia were \nsignificantly more enriched in the EBS group than that in the healthy group (P < \n.05). Four species of the above genera were isolated and identified, including \nE11004 (Abiotrophia defectiva), E3101(Lautropia mirabilis), E1715 (Arachnia \npropionica) and E10012 (Arachnia rubra). E3101 possessed the highest number of \niron metabolism and biofilm-related genes among the isolates. Two genes, \nincluding 4-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase (K23470) and \n4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (K05606), encoding key enzymes in the \nmelanin synthesis pathway, were found in E3101, E1715 and E10012.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identifies E11004, E3101, E1715 and E10012 as \nspecies-level contributors to EBS, with genomic evidence implicating their \npotential roles in iron metabolism, biofilm formation and melanin production. \nThese findings highlight the need for functional studies to elucidate their \nmechanistic roles in EBS pathogenesis.\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying E11004, E3101, E1715 and E10012 as key \ncontributors to EBS offers potential targets for novel preventive or therapeutic \nstrategies, such as antimicrobial agents or biofilm inhibitors, to reduce \nrecurrence and alleviate the aesthetic burden in affected children.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

This study aimed to profile the gastric mucosal microbiota in \npatients with Helicobacter pylori-negative precancerous lesions. Gastric mucosal \nsamples were obtained from 67 H. pylori-negative patients, including those with \nchronic gastritis (CG), intestinal metaplasia (IM), and dysplasia. The V3-V4 \nregion of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced and analyzed. No significant \ndifference was observed in the alpha or beta diversity of the gastric microbiota \namong the groups. However, a taxonomic analysis revealed a significant \nenrichment of Lautropia mirabilis and the depletion of Limosilactobacillus \nreuteri, Solobacxterium moorei, Haemophilus haemolyticus, and Duncaniella \ndubosii in the IM and dysplasia groups compared to those in the CG group. \nPrevotella jejuni and the genus Parvimonas were enriched in the IM group. A \npredictive functional analysis revealed enrichment of the ornithine degradation \npathway in the IM and dysplasia groups, suggesting its role in persistent \ngastric mucosal inflammation associated with gastric precancerous lesions. The \ngastric microbiota associated with H. pylori-negative gastric precancerous \nlesions showed an increased abundance of oral microbes linked to gastric cancer \nand a reduction in anti-inflammatory bacteria. These alterations might \ncontribute to chronic gastric mucosal inflammation, promoting carcinogenesis in \nthe absence of H. pylori infection.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/microorganisms13010081\nPMCID: PMC11767925\nPMID: 39858849\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'},

This study aims to address the dynamic changes in oral \nmicrobiome following cancer treatment and their prognostic implications in NPC \npatients.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Unstimulated whole saliva samples were collected from 23 \nNPC patients before and after treatment, with an average of 2.8 samples per \npatient, and post-treatment saliva samples were collected from additional 13 NPC \npatients that enrolled after treatment. Following DNA extraction and \npurification, the salivary microbiome was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon \nsequencing targeting the V4\xa0hypervariable region.\nRESULTS: Alpha-diversity of oral microbiome decreased progressively after \ntreatment and during follow-up, and the beta-diversity of post-treatment samples \ndiffered significantly from the pre-treatment ones (R 2\u2009=\u20090.032, p\u2009<\u20090.001). \nAmong patients free of disease progression, 31 oral taxa were identified that \nchanged significantly in abundances after treatment, with 8 increasing and 23 \ndecreasing. The declining taxa included two previously reported NPC-enriched \nbacteria, Lautropia mirabilis and Capnocytophaga sputigena. In contrast, in the \nonly recurrent case, the abundances of the two bacteria did not decrease, but \nremained at high levels or even increased until recurrence occurred.\nCONCLUSION: NPC treatment can cause persistent decline in microbial diversity of \nsalivary microbiome and abundances of NPC-associated bacteria, and candidate \nbacteria could be an explanatory factor for NPC prognosis and deserve intensive \nresearch.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Community diversity of oral microbiome decreased after \ntreatment in NPC patients.Overall abundance of NPC-enriched bacteria declined \nafter treatment.Specific bacteria could be potential indicators for NPC \nrecurrence.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Here, we detected L. mirabilis in two different blood cultures. The \nbacterium was tested susceptible to and treated with meropenem. As the origin of \nL. mirabilis sepsis, we observed an active periodontitis likely due to impaired \nIgA levels and mucosal insufficiency as a consequence of CVID.

Methods: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive multi-omics \nanalysis of saliva samples (n = 20 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 20 \nAlzheimer's disease and age- and n = 40 gender-matched cognitively normal \nindividuals), from the South Australian Neurodegenerative Disease (SAND) cohort, \nintegrating proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome data with plasma \nmeasurements, including pTau181.

Pathway \nanalysis revealed significant alterations in vitamin B12 metabolism, with \nTranscobalamin-1 levels decreasing in saliva as AD progressed despite an \nincrease in serum vitamin B12 levels (p = 0.008). Microbiome analysis identified \nshifts in bacterial composition, with a microbiome cluster containing species \nsuch as Lautropia mirabilis showing a significant decrease in abundance in MCI \nand AD samples. The overall findings were reinforced by weighted correlation \nnetwork analysis, which identified key hubs and enriched pathways associated \nwith AD.

However, \nthe specific effect and the mechanism of smoking in RAS are unclear. In this \nstudy, 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used to compare the differences in \nsaliva microbial community between 28 non-smoking healthy controls (NSctrl), 31 \nnon-smoking RAS patients (NSras), and 19 smoking RAS patients (Sras). The \nresults showed that the bacterial community diversity in patients with RAS \n(NSras and Sras) was lower than that of NSctrl. The microbial community in \nsmoking-associated RAS is less diverse and distinct from that of non-smokers. \nThe RAS groups have higher abundance of Veillonella, Rothia, and Sneathia and \nlower abundance of Bacteroidales, Bacteroides, Wolinella, Moryella, \nPyramidobacter, and Christensenellaceae at the genera level. A significantly \ndifferent abundance of Anaerovorax, Candidatus Endomicrobium, Lactococcus, \nSneathia, Veillonella, and Cloacibacterium was observed between the Sras and the \nNSras group. Notably, there was a significant difference in many species from \nthe genus Prevotella and Treponema between the NSras and the Sras group. \nFurther, the relative abundance of several taxa is correlated with smoking age \nor frequency, including Megasphaera, Haemophilus, Leptotrichia, and Rothia at \nthe genera level, and Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella salivae, Megasphaera \nmicronuciformis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Alloprevotella tannerae, \nActinomyces naeslundii, Lautropia mirabilis, and Capnocytophaga sputigena at the \nspecies level. Among patients with RAS, smoking aggravated the pathways of \nrespiration and human pathogens. Our results suggest that smoking is closely \nrelated to changes in the oral microbiota, which may contribute an opposite \neffect to the pathogenesis of RAS.

While the microbiota \nplays a key role in EBS formation, the specific microbial features remain poorly \nunderstood. The aim of the study was to explore the microbial characteristics of \nchildren aged 3-5 years with the EBS.\nMETHODS: EBS (30) and healthy (30) supragingiva plaque samples were collected \nfor comparative analysis. The microbial features of the 2 groups were \ninvestigated using Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology and verified by \nquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Potential EBS-dominant genera \nwere isolated and identified, followed by whole-genome sequencing and \nbio-informatic analysis.\nRESULTS: The qPCR results verified that Abiotrophia, Lautropia and Arachnia were \nsignificantly more enriched in the EBS group than that in the healthy group (P < \n.05). Four species of the above genera were isolated and identified, including \nE11004 (Abiotrophia defectiva), E3101(Lautropia mirabilis), E1715 (Arachnia \npropionica) and E10012 (Arachnia rubra). E3101 possessed the highest number of \niron metabolism and biofilm-related genes among the isolates. Two genes, \nincluding 4-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase (K23470) and \n4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (K05606), encoding key enzymes in the \nmelanin synthesis pathway, were found in E3101, E1715 and E10012.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identifies E11004, E3101, E1715 and E10012 as \nspecies-level contributors to EBS, with genomic evidence implicating their \npotential roles in iron metabolism, biofilm formation and melanin production. \nThese findings highlight the need for functional studies to elucidate their \nmechanistic roles in EBS pathogenesis.\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying E11004, E3101, E1715 and E10012 as key \ncontributors to EBS offers potential targets for novel preventive or therapeutic \nstrategies, such as antimicrobial agents or biofilm inhibitors, to reduce \nrecurrence and alleviate the aesthetic burden in affected children.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

This study aims to address the dynamic changes in oral \nmicrobiome following cancer treatment and their prognostic implications in NPC \npatients.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Unstimulated whole saliva samples were collected from 23 \nNPC patients before and after treatment, with an average of 2.8 samples per \npatient, and post-treatment saliva samples were collected from additional 13 NPC \npatients that enrolled after treatment. Following DNA extraction and \npurification, the salivary microbiome was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon \nsequencing targeting the V4\xa0hypervariable region.\nRESULTS: Alpha-diversity of oral microbiome decreased progressively after \ntreatment and during follow-up, and the beta-diversity of post-treatment samples \ndiffered significantly from the pre-treatment ones (R 2\u2009=\u20090.032, p\u2009<\u20090.001). \nAmong patients free of disease progression, 31 oral taxa were identified that \nchanged significantly in abundances after treatment, with 8 increasing and 23 \ndecreasing. The declining taxa included two previously reported NPC-enriched \nbacteria, Lautropia mirabilis and Capnocytophaga sputigena. In contrast, in the \nonly recurrent case, the abundances of the two bacteria did not decrease, but \nremained at high levels or even increased until recurrence occurred.\nCONCLUSION: NPC treatment can cause persistent decline in microbial diversity of \nsalivary microbiome and abundances of NPC-associated bacteria, and candidate \nbacteria could be an explanatory factor for NPC prognosis and deserve intensive \nresearch.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Community diversity of oral microbiome decreased after \ntreatment in NPC patients.Overall abundance of NPC-enriched bacteria declined \nafter treatment.Specific bacteria could be potential indicators for NPC \nrecurrence.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Despite extensive research, the detailed \necological and metabolic shifts underlying S-ECC pathogenesis are still poorly \ncharacterized. Integrating microbial and metabolic profiling of saliva may \nprovide crucial insights and identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\nMETHODS: We performed high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted \nmetabolomics to comprehensively profile the salivary microbiome and metabolome \nin children with S-ECC (n\u2009=\u200930) compared to caries-free (CF) controls (n\u2009=\u200930). \nDifferential microbial taxa and metabolites were identified, and their \nfunctional implications were explored through KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. \nFurthermore, integrated correlation analysis was conducted to uncover \ninteractions between key microbial taxa and metabolites.\nRESULTS: Microbial community analysis revealed significant ecological \nalterations in the saliva of children with S-ECC, characterized by enrichment of \npotentially cariogenic taxa, including Rothia, Lautropia, Lactobacillus, \nAchromobacter, as well as Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella histicola, and \nLachnoanaerobaculum saburreum. Conversely, health-associated genera such as \nBergeyella and Acinetobacter were more abundant in CF children. Metabolomics \nidentified a total of 4,325 salivary metabolites, among which 1,226 differed \nsignificantly between groups. Notably, metabolites involved in amino acid \nmetabolism pathways-phenylalanine, tyrosine, D-amino acids, aminobenzoate, \narginine, and proline-were upregulated in S-ECC saliva. Integrated analysis \nfurther revealed strong positive correlations between key cariogenic bacteria \n(S. mutans, P. histicola, L. saburreum) and multiple metabolites, including \nsuccinic acid, 2-piperidone, D-3-phenyllactic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, L-malic \nacid, 2-hydroxypalmitic acid, LPE (16:0), vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide, leucylproline, \nand L-valine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate distinct ecological and functional \nsignatures in the salivary microbiome and metabolome associated with S-ECC. The \nidentified microbial and metabolic alterations, particularly in amino acid \nmetabolism, provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of S-ECC and highlight \npotential biomarkers for early detection and targeted intervention. However, the \ncross-sectional design and single time-point saliva collection limit the ability \nto assess longitudinal dynamics.

While the microbiota \nplays a key role in EBS formation, the specific microbial features remain poorly \nunderstood. The aim of the study was to explore the microbial characteristics of \nchildren aged 3-5 years with the EBS.\nMETHODS: EBS (30) and healthy (30) supragingiva plaque samples were collected \nfor comparative analysis. The microbial features of the 2 groups were \ninvestigated using Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology and verified by \nquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Potential EBS-dominant genera \nwere isolated and identified, followed by whole-genome sequencing and \nbio-informatic analysis.\nRESULTS: The qPCR results verified that Abiotrophia, Lautropia and Arachnia were \nsignificantly more enriched in the EBS group than that in the healthy group (P < \n.05). Four species of the above genera were isolated and identified, including \nE11004 (Abiotrophia defectiva), E3101(Lautropia mirabilis), E1715 (Arachnia \npropionica) and E10012 (Arachnia rubra). E3101 possessed the highest number of \niron metabolism and biofilm-related genes among the isolates. Two genes, \nincluding 4-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase (K23470) and \n4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (K05606), encoding key enzymes in the \nmelanin synthesis pathway, were found in E3101, E1715 and E10012.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identifies E11004, E3101, E1715 and E10012 as \nspecies-level contributors to EBS, with genomic evidence implicating their \npotential roles in iron metabolism, biofilm formation and melanin production. \nThese findings highlight the need for functional studies to elucidate their \nmechanistic roles in EBS pathogenesis.\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying E11004, E3101, E1715 and E10012 as key \ncontributors to EBS offers potential targets for novel preventive or therapeutic \nstrategies, such as antimicrobial agents or biofilm inhibitors, to reduce \nrecurrence and alleviate the aesthetic burden in affected children.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

At a finer level, certain \nsubcommunities may exhibit stable signature across the sampling space. There can \nalso be similarity of differential patterns across different body sites. In view \nof above, and leveraging recent advancements in analytical strategies, we \nrevisit a multi-factorial Iranian ColoRectal Cancer (CRC) dataset, and explore \nstable and persistent patterns in the microbiome. For this purpose, 16S rRNA \ngene is amplified from saliva and stool samples of CRC patients using healthy \ncontrols as a baseline (n = 80). The dataset is supplemented with demographical \nand nutritional data of the study participants that were collected through \nfilled questionnaire. Our results indicate that certain microbial species i.e., \nActinobacteriota, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella and Fusobacterium are consistently \npresent in the CRC patients suggesting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers \nof disease. Additionally, we identified a group of microbes such as Akkermansia, \nSelenomonas, Clostridia_UCG-014, Lautropia, Granulicatella, Bifidobacterium, and \nGemella that exhibit similar differential response across body sites \nirrespective of where they are found, whether in saliva or stool samples. This \nsuggest that a part of saliva microbiome can act as a proxy for stool microbiome \ngiving further credence to oral-gut axis.

It represents the most common form of acquired heart disease \nin this population. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota can modulate \nthe gut-vascular axis, influencing coronary artery lesions (CALs). This study \naims to elucidate the potential association between gut microbiota, KD, and \nCALs, as well as identify bacterial biomarkers for CALs.\nMETHODS: We analyzed the gut microbiota composition of 60 children with KD (15 \nin the acute phase, 45 in the nonacute phase) and 30 healthy controls using \nalpha diversity indices and t-tests. Microbial biomarkers were identified \nthrough LEfSe to analyze the interplay between gut microbiota and CALs in KD \nduring acute and non-acute phases.\nRESULTS: In the acute phase, KD children exhibited decreased richness and \ndiversity of gut microbiota, characterized by dysbiosis, particularly a \nreduction in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and overgrowth of \nopportunistic pathogens. Thirteen genera showed statistically significant \nchanges, including Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Agathobacter, \nLachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Roseburia, Monoglobus, etc. LEfSe analysis \nrevealed enrichment of Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, Hungatella, \nand Clostridium_innocuum group in patients with concurrent CALs, while Halomonas \nwas depleted. In the nonacute phase, gut microbiota diversity was similar to \nhealthy controls, but Streptococcus was upregulated, while \nEubacterium_eligens_group and Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG_003 were downregulated. \nCALs were associated with reduced Anaerostipes, Subdoligranulum, Roseburia, and \nLachnospira. LEfSe analysis also showed enrichment of Coprobacillus, Paludicola, \nLautropia, UCG-009, Acetanaerobacterium, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, and \nAlistipes in patients with CALs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence of gut microbiota dysbiosis in KD \nchildren, suggesting its involvement in CALs development.

While the determinants \nof periodontitis have been extensively investigated in other populations, such \nstudies are lacking in South Africa, which represents a high-risk population. \nTherefore, this study was conducted to characterize the subgingival bacterial \nbiodiversity in the periodontal pockets of patients with periodontitis in a \nWestern Cape population.\nMATERIALS & METHODS: Pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from the \ndeepest pocket/crevices of five periodontitis cases and five controls using \nsterile paper points. Illumina MiSeq paired-end sequencing and QIIME2 software \nwere employed for sequence filtration and analysis. Several alpha and \nbeta-diversity metrics assessed biodiversity within-sample and population \nstructure between different microbiota datasets, respectively. Statistical \nsignificance for alpha diversity was tested using the Kruskal-Wallis H test \n(p\u2009<\u20090.05), and beta diversity differences were evaluated using PERMANOVA. Data \nvisualization, including beta diversity plots, was conducted with the Phyloseq \npackage in R.\nRESULTS: Beta-diversity measures revealed significant differences between \nperiodontitis cases and controls (p-value\u2009=\u20090.04), whereas alpha-diversity was \nhigher in cases, though without statistical significance (p-value\u2009≥\u20090.05).

It represents the most common form of acquired heart disease \nin this population. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota can modulate \nthe gut-vascular axis, influencing coronary artery lesions (CALs). This study \naims to elucidate the potential association between gut microbiota, KD, and \nCALs, as well as identify bacterial biomarkers for CALs.\nMETHODS: We analyzed the gut microbiota composition of 60 children with KD (15 \nin the acute phase, 45 in the nonacute phase) and 30 healthy controls using \nalpha diversity indices and t-tests. Microbial biomarkers were identified \nthrough LEfSe to analyze the interplay between gut microbiota and CALs in KD \nduring acute and non-acute phases.\nRESULTS: In the acute phase, KD children exhibited decreased richness and \ndiversity of gut microbiota, characterized by dysbiosis, particularly a \nreduction in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and overgrowth of \nopportunistic pathogens. Thirteen genera showed statistically significant \nchanges, including Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Agathobacter, \nLachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group, Roseburia, Monoglobus, etc. LEfSe analysis \nrevealed enrichment of Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, Hungatella, \nand Clostridium_innocuum group in patients with concurrent CALs, while Halomonas \nwas depleted. In the nonacute phase, gut microbiota diversity was similar to \nhealthy controls, but Streptococcus was upregulated, while \nEubacterium_eligens_group and Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG_003 were downregulated. \nCALs were associated with reduced Anaerostipes, Subdoligranulum, Roseburia, and \nLachnospira. LEfSe analysis also showed enrichment of Coprobacillus, Paludicola, \nLautropia, UCG-009, Acetanaerobacterium, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, and \nAlistipes in patients with CALs.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence of gut microbiota dysbiosis in KD \nchildren, suggesting its involvement in CALs development. It indicates that \nunder the premise of standardized treatment during the acute phase of KD, it is \nplausible that microbiota-targeted strategies may alleviate CALs, thereby \nimproving patient prognosis.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Yang, Tang, Ren, Li and Zhao.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2025.1560083\nPMCID: PMC12158935\nPMID: 40510796 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

The oral microbiota is the second most complex microbial community \nin the human body. It has been suggested that poor oral health may be associated \nwith an increased risk of obesity.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. However, both \nprevious observational and mechanistic studies on oral microbiota do not take \ninto account the obesity-related acanthosis nigricans (AN), which is the most \ncommon dermatological manifestation in individuals with obesity.Aim. This study \naimed to investigate the altered composition, function and diagnostic value of \nthe oral microbiota in obesity with or without acanthosis nigricans \n(AN).Methodology. We characterized the oral bacteria signature in a Chinese \ncohort (ChiCTR2300073353) of 99\u2009patients with obesity and obesity-related AN \n(Ob_AN) and 50 healthy controls using 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region \nsequencing.Results. The microbial richness (abundance-based coverage estimators \nand observed species indices) was significantly greater in the Ob_AN and obesity \ngroups than in the control group; however, microbial diversity (Shannon index) \ndid not differ significantly. Distinct separation in the microbial community \namongst the three groups was observed. Prevotella species, including Prevotella \nmelaninogenica, Prevotella nanceiensis and Prevotella pallens, were associated \nwith composition alterations and predicted functions (significant downregulation \nof ATP-binding cassette transporters) associated with microbial dysbiosis in the \nobesity and Ob_AN groups. Moreover, Prevotella and Lautropia genera assessments \ncould indicate obesity and obesity-related AN risk.Conclusions. The notable \nreduction of plenty of oral microbiota and high levels of Prevotella spp. may \nplay a critical role in obesity with AN. Oral microbiota may serve as biomarkers \nfor diagnosing, preventing and even treating obesity-related AN.\n\nDOI: 10.1099/jmm.0.002020\nPMCID: PMC12137914\nPMID: 40465467 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there are no conflicts \nof interest."},

Despite extensive research, the detailed \necological and metabolic shifts underlying S-ECC pathogenesis are still poorly \ncharacterized. Integrating microbial and metabolic profiling of saliva may \nprovide crucial insights and identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\nMETHODS: We performed high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted \nmetabolomics to comprehensively profile the salivary microbiome and metabolome \nin children with S-ECC (n\u2009=\u200930) compared to caries-free (CF) controls (n\u2009=\u200930). \nDifferential microbial taxa and metabolites were identified, and their \nfunctional implications were explored through KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. \nFurthermore, integrated correlation analysis was conducted to uncover \ninteractions between key microbial taxa and metabolites.\nRESULTS: Microbial community analysis revealed significant ecological \nalterations in the saliva of children with S-ECC, characterized by enrichment of \npotentially cariogenic taxa, including Rothia, Lautropia, Lactobacillus, \nAchromobacter, as well as Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella histicola, and \nLachnoanaerobaculum saburreum. Conversely, health-associated genera such as \nBergeyella and Acinetobacter were more abundant in CF children. Metabolomics \nidentified a total of 4,325 salivary metabolites, among which 1,226 differed \nsignificantly between groups. Notably, metabolites involved in amino acid \nmetabolism pathways-phenylalanine, tyrosine, D-amino acids, aminobenzoate, \narginine, and proline-were upregulated in S-ECC saliva. Integrated analysis \nfurther revealed strong positive correlations between key cariogenic bacteria \n(S. mutans, P. histicola, L. saburreum) and multiple metabolites, including \nsuccinic acid, 2-piperidone, D-3-phenyllactic acid, 5-aminovaleric acid, L-malic \nacid, 2-hydroxypalmitic acid, LPE (16:0), vitamin K1 2,3-epoxide, leucylproline, \nand L-valine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate distinct ecological and functional \nsignatures in the salivary microbiome and metabolome associated with S-ECC. The \nidentified microbial and metabolic alterations, particularly in amino acid \nmetabolism, provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of S-ECC and highlight \npotential biomarkers for early detection and targeted intervention. However, the \ncross-sectional design and single time-point saliva collection limit the ability \nto assess longitudinal dynamics. Future longitudinal studies are warranted to \ntrack microbial and metabolomic changes during disease progression and \nintervention.\n\n© 2025.

While the microbiota \nplays a key role in EBS formation, the specific microbial features remain poorly \nunderstood. The aim of the study was to explore the microbial characteristics of \nchildren aged 3-5 years with the EBS.\nMETHODS: EBS (30) and healthy (30) supragingiva plaque samples were collected \nfor comparative analysis. The microbial features of the 2 groups were \ninvestigated using Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology and verified by \nquantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Potential EBS-dominant genera \nwere isolated and identified, followed by whole-genome sequencing and \nbio-informatic analysis.\nRESULTS: The qPCR results verified that Abiotrophia, Lautropia and Arachnia were \nsignificantly more enriched in the EBS group than that in the healthy group (P < \n.05). Four species of the above genera were isolated and identified, including \nE11004 (Abiotrophia defectiva), E3101(Lautropia mirabilis), E1715 (Arachnia \npropionica) and E10012 (Arachnia rubra). E3101 possessed the highest number of \niron metabolism and biofilm-related genes among the isolates. Two genes, \nincluding 4-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase (K23470) and \n4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (K05606), encoding key enzymes in the \nmelanin synthesis pathway, were found in E3101, E1715 and E10012.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study identifies E11004, E3101, E1715 and E10012 as \nspecies-level contributors to EBS, with genomic evidence implicating their \npotential roles in iron metabolism, biofilm formation and melanin production. \nThese findings highlight the need for functional studies to elucidate their \nmechanistic roles in EBS pathogenesis.\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Identifying E11004, E3101, E1715 and E10012 as key \ncontributors to EBS offers potential targets for novel preventive or therapeutic \nstrategies, such as antimicrobial agents or biofilm inhibitors, to reduce \nrecurrence and alleviate the aesthetic burden in affected children.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Herein, microaerobic \nsludge systems (∼38.2 and ∼12.1\xa0μM dissolved oxygen) were conducted to \ninvestigate the performance of simultaneous methane (CH4) oxidation and N2O \nconsumption compared with hypoxic conditions. During the whole experiment, the \naverage N2O consumption rate in the high dissolved oxygen sludge system with CH4 \nwas 3.4-4.9 times that of the others. A positively linear correlation was \nobserved between the CH4 oxidation rate and the N2O consumption rate in the \nsludge systems. Compared to the treatment without CH4, the N2O consumption rate \nwas higher in the treatment with CH4, indicating that aerobic CH4 oxidation \nmight be related with the N2O consumption in the systems. The N2O consumption in \nthe microaerobic system was influenced by the O2, CH4 and NH4+-N concentrations \nand was regulated by the microbial species.

Bio-manufactured \nAgNPs from this isolate were characterized, including UV-visible spectroscopy \n(with wavelength peaks at 437\u202fnm), FTIR, and X-ray diffraction, validating the \ncrystalline configuration of the AgNPs, exhibiting intensity peaks at 28.02°, \n32.46°, and 46.36°. The spherical shape and size (96\u202fnm diameter) along with the \nsilver content (87.06% w/w) of bio-synthesized AgNPs was confirmed through \nscanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. \nMetabolomic analysis through LC-MS revealed the presence of bioactive compounds \npossessing significant antimicrobial and anti-cancer properties, in addition to \nmarked reduction capabilities. They have manifested notable antibacterial \npotential against Staphylococcus aureus with a 14\u202fmm zone of inhibition and also \nproved effectiveness against Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, and \nEscherichia coli. Additionally, the AgNPs effectively removed trimethoprim, \nachieving a 63.42% removal at 10\u202fppm within 120\u202fmin. These bio-fabricated AgNPs \ndisplayed remarkable anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity against the \nTHP-1 monocytic leukemia cell line, yielding an IC50 measurement of 40\u202fμg/mL. \nThese findings underscore the prospective applications of biogenic AgNPs in \nwastewater treatment and biomedical fields, illustrating their multiple \nfunctionalities.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Prajapati, Panchal, Dikshit, Patel, Bhavsar, Patel, Sahoo and \nLuhana.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1658320\nPMCID: PMC12612684\nPMID: 41244679\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

The study was conducted at \nthe Department of Microbiology and General Surgery, Institute of Medical \nSciences, Varanasi, over a period of 1 year (September 2016 to July 2017).\nMETHODS: Purulent exudate (pus) samples were collected from 20 patients with \nprimary PNS from the discharging sinuses by aseptic methods. Samples were \nassessed for aerobic and anaerobic flora by conventional culture and molecular \nmethods. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done for bacterial isolates. \nBacterial diversity was compared with the demographic and clinical profile of \nthe sinuses by multiple correspondence analysis.\nRESULTS: Of the total cases, 11 (55%) had purulent discharge, among which all \nshowed polymicrobial flora. The ratio of aerobic to anaerobic organisms was 1:2 \n(16/32). Escherichia coli (E. coli, 4, 36.36%) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. \nfaecalis, 4, 36.36%) were commonly isolated. Bifidobacterium was the most \nfrequent anaerobe. Detailed molecular analysis revealed the presence of Kocuria \nflava as an unusual pathogen. On statistical analysis, factors like male gender, \nincreased body mass index, absence of hair in sinus, presence of features of \nhirsutism, and absence of Fusobacteria were closely associated with one another \nin these PNS cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: The case series revealed the predominance of anaerobes in primarily \ninfected PNS cases. Bifidobacterium spp and unusual pathogens like K. flava were \namong the emerging pathogens in infected PNS. Use of better molecular diagnostic \nfacilities in addition to the conventional methods might enhance the verified \ndiversity of microorganisms in such cases.\n\nCopyright © 2023 by the Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurses Society.\n\nDOI: 10.1097/WON.0000000000000945\nPMID: 36668986 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'},

Paper mill sludge, an important \nlignocellulosic biomass creates an environmental threat, which requires \nfinancial input for disposal. Thus, this study was aimed to isolate a novel \nbacterial strain capable of degrading cellulosic biomass including paper mill \nsludge to produce reducing sugar and other value-added bioproducts.\nRESULTS: A novel bacterial strain Arthrobacter woluwensis TDS9 isolated from the \nsoil was screened for its cellulolytic activity using carboxymethyl cellulose \n(CMC) as the sole carbon source. The incubation\xa0period, temperature, pH, carbon, \nand nitrogen sources are the most important factors ruling the CMCase and sugar \nproductions of the strain A. woluwensis TDS9, and an alkaline pH (pH 8.0) led to \nenhanced sugar production up to 1100.09 μg/mL after 72 h of incubation at 25°C \nin a medium containing 1.5% CMC and 1.25% beef extract. The optimal conditions \nfor maximum CMCase activity were defined, and the potassium ion boosted the \nCMCase activity up to 1.06 U/mL when the enzymatic reaction was performed for 30 \nmin at 50°C and pH 8 using CMC as a substrate. Moreover, the strain A. \nwoluwensis TDS9 produced 433.33 μg/mL reducing sugar from 1% pretreated paper \nmill sludge. Significant alterations in the structural arrangement of cellulosic \nfiber of paper mill sludge observed under microscope after each step of chemical \ntreatment process helped for loosening the cellulose fibers and increased the \nsaccharification for enzymatic hydrolysis. Endoglucanase IV (33 KDa) and \nbeta-glucosidase II (53 KDa) were identified in crude enzyme based on the \nzymogram analysis and substrate specificity.\nCONCLUSIONS: The research has for the first time proved that this A. woluwensis \nTDS9 strain can efficiently convert cellulose. Therefore, the strain TDS9 could \nbe a potential candidate for cellulase production in an industrial \nbiotransformation process of paper mill sludge to produce reducing sugar. This \nsugar stream can be further used as a substrate to produce biofuels and other \norganic acids using another microorganism, which represents a greener \nalternative to add value to the paper production helping paper mill industries.\n\n© 2022.

The polar \nlipids comprised diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, \nphosphatidylinositol and three glycolipids. Cell-wall analysis revealed that the \npeptidoglycan type was A3α, based on l-lysine-l-alanine; the cell-wall sugars \nwere galactose and mannose. The genomic G+C content of strain A33(T) was 66.8 \nmol%.

But with the \ncommencement of more sophisticated advances in agricultural techniques, organic \nfarming has gradually become limited in the world. Culture-dependent plant \ngrowth-promoting bacterial isolates were isolated from the bulk and rhizospheric \nsoil, of the native high yielding pole type organic pea (Pisum sativum L.) \ncultivar Dentami of Dentam, West Sikkim, India. Based on the 16S rRNA gene \nsequencing identification of these isolates, it was found that from the bulk \nsoil, Actinobacteria (58%) was the dominant phyla followed by Firmicutes (28%), \nand Proteobacteria (14%). In the rhizospheric soil it was dominated by \nProteobacteria (56%), followed by Firmicutes (33%), and Bacteriodetes (11%). A \ntotal of 40 bacterial isolates were initially screened for the plant \ngrowth-promoting (PGP) activity and out of them only four bacterial isolates \ni.e., Bacillus cereus P8, Arthrobacter woluwensis DP2, Paenarthrobacter \nnitroguajacolicus PP3, and Bacillus mycoides PP10 with accession numbers \nMN589697, MN559516, MN519462 and MN589696 respectively were found to possess \nhigher PGP activity (i.e. phosphorous, potassium solubilization and \nnitrogen-fixing activity) as compared to the other bacteria present in the soil. \nBased on the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) quantitative assay and siderophore \nproduction assay, it was found that Bacillus cereus (MN589697) produced the \nhighest IAA (65.5\xa0µg mL-1) and siderophore (71%) when compared with the other \nisolates. The statistical correlation suggests that pH and available phosphorus \nwere the strongest influencing factors for the distribution of Proteobacteria in \nthe rhizospheric soil. The results indicate that these isolates can be potential \nplant growth promoter under the agro-climatic conditions of Sikkim, India. To \nthe best of our knowledge the present study is the first report of its kind and \nshowcases significant findings pertaining to the assessment of diversity, \nisolation and identification of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria of organic \npea grown in Sikkim.\n\n© 2021 The Author(s).

In a previous study, we found that dietary inclusions \nof Bacillus subtilis (BS) and Macleaya cordata extract (MCE) increased dry \nmatter intake and milk production, while reduced enteric CH4 emission in dairy \ncows. The objective of this study was to further elucidate the impact of feeding \nBS and MCE on rumen methanogenesis in dairy cows using rumen metagenomics \ntechniques.\nRESULTS: Sixty dairy cows were blocked in 20 groups of 3 cows accordingly to \ntheir live weight, milk yield, and days in milk, and within each group, the 3 \ncows were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatments: control diet (CON), control \ndiet plus BS (BS), and control diet plus MCE (MCE). After 75 days of feeding \nexperimental diets, 12 cows were selected from each treatment for collection of \nrumen samples for the metagenomic sequencing. Results showed that BS decreased \nruminal acetate and butyrate, while increased propionate concentrations, \nresulting in decreased acetate:propionate ratio. The metagenomics analysis \nrevealed that MCE reduced relative abundances of Methanobrevibacter wolinii, \nMethanobrevibacter sp. AbM4, Candidatus Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis, \nMethanobrevibacter cuticularis, Methanomicrobium mobile, Methanobacterium \nformicicum, and Methanobacterium congolense. Both BS and MCE reduced relative \nabundances of Methanosphaera sp. WGK6 and Methanosphaera stadtmanae. The \nco-occurrence network analysis of rumen bacteria and archaea revealed that \ndietary treatments influenced microbial interaction patterns, with BS and MCE \ncows having more and stronger associations than CON cows. The random forest and \nheatmaps analysis demonstrated that the Halopenitus persicus was positively \ncorrelated with fat- and protein-corrected milk yield; Clostridium sp. CAG 269, \nClostridium sp. 27 14, Haloarcula rubripromontorii, and Methanobrevibacter \ncurvatus were negatively correlated with rumen acetate and butyrate \nconcentrations, and acetate:propionate ratio, whereas Selenomonas rumiantium was \npositively correlated with those variables.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present results provided new information for mitigation of \nenteric methane emissions of dairy cows by feeding BS and MCE to influence rumen \nmicrobial activities. This fundamental knowledge is essential for developing \nenteric CH4 reduction strategies to mitigate climate change and reduce dietary \nenergy waste. Video Abstract.\n\n© 2023.

In a previous study, we found that dietary inclusions \nof Bacillus subtilis (BS) and Macleaya cordata extract (MCE) increased dry \nmatter intake and milk production, while reduced enteric CH4 emission in dairy \ncows. The objective of this study was to further elucidate the impact of feeding \nBS and MCE on rumen methanogenesis in dairy cows using rumen metagenomics \ntechniques.\nRESULTS: Sixty dairy cows were blocked in 20 groups of 3 cows accordingly to \ntheir live weight, milk yield, and days in milk, and within each group, the 3 \ncows were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 treatments: control diet (CON), control \ndiet plus BS (BS), and control diet plus MCE (MCE). After 75 days of feeding \nexperimental diets, 12 cows were selected from each treatment for collection of \nrumen samples for the metagenomic sequencing. Results showed that BS decreased \nruminal acetate and butyrate, while increased propionate concentrations, \nresulting in decreased acetate:propionate ratio. The metagenomics analysis \nrevealed that MCE reduced relative abundances of Methanobrevibacter wolinii, \nMethanobrevibacter sp. AbM4, Candidatus Methanomassiliicoccus intestinalis, \nMethanobrevibacter cuticularis, Methanomicrobium mobile, Methanobacterium \nformicicum, and Methanobacterium congolense. Both BS and MCE reduced relative \nabundances of Methanosphaera sp. WGK6 and Methanosphaera stadtmanae. The \nco-occurrence network analysis of rumen bacteria and archaea revealed that \ndietary treatments influenced microbial interaction patterns, with BS and MCE \ncows having more and stronger associations than CON cows. The random forest and \nheatmaps analysis demonstrated that the Halopenitus persicus was positively \ncorrelated with fat- and protein-corrected milk yield; Clostridium sp. CAG 269, \nClostridium sp. 27 14, Haloarcula rubripromontorii, and Methanobrevibacter \ncurvatus were negatively correlated with rumen acetate and butyrate \nconcentrations, and acetate:propionate ratio, whereas Selenomonas rumiantium was \npositively correlated with those variables.\nCONCLUSIONS: The present results provided new information for mitigation of \nenteric methane emissions of dairy cows by feeding BS and MCE to influence rumen \nmicrobial activities. This fundamental knowledge is essential for developing \nenteric CH4 reduction strategies to mitigate climate change and reduce dietary \nenergy waste. Video Abstract.\n\n© 2023.

The enrichment degraded benzoate as the \nsole carbon source at salinity ranging from 2.0 to 5.0\xa0M NaCl with highest rate \nof degradation observed at 4.0\xa0M. The enrichment was also tested for its ability \nto grow on other aromatic compounds such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), \ngentisic acid, protocatechuic acid (PCA), catechol, benzene and toluene as the \nsole sources of carbon and energy. Of these, the culture only utilized 4-HBA as \nthe carbon source. To determine the initial steps in benzoate degradation \npathway, a survey of ring-oxidizing and ring-cleaving genes was performed using \ndegenerate PCR primers. Results showed the presence of 4-hydroxybenzoate \n3-monooxygenase (4-HBMO) and protocatechuate 3, 4-dioxygenase (3,4-PCA) genes \nsuggesting that the archaeal enrichment might degrade benzoate to 4-HBA that is \nfurther converted to PCA by 4-HBMO and, thus, formed PCA would undergo \nring-cleavage by 3,4-PCA to form intermediates that enter the Krebs cycle.

The morphological features (pigments \nand cell sizes) of a new strain Lysobacter sp. Hz25 were studied during \ncultivation on different media.

This study aimed to \ninvestigate the impact of Dematophora necatrix, the causal agent of white root \nrot (WRR), on the microbial composition and soil physicochemical properties of \ninfected and non-infected avocado trees in two South African orchards.\nMETHODS: ITS and 16S metabarcoding was used to compare the composition and \ndiversity of the rhizosphere microbiome. Soil physicochemical properties were \nalso assessed, and culturable bacterial and fungal isolates from the rhizosphere \nwere screened for antagonistic activity against D. necatrix.\nRESULTS: We found that D. necatrix did not significantly alter overall microbial \ndiversity but influenced relative abundance of specific taxa. In Orchard A, \ndominant bacterial genera included Sphingomonas, Rokubacteriales and Lysobacter, \nwhile Orchard B featured Sphingomonas and Acidothermus while beneficial microbes \nsuch as Streptomyces and Bacillus were enriched in WRR non-infected (WRR-N) \nsoils. The fungal profiles revealed Trichoderma and Penicillium as potential \nbiocontrol agents enriched in WRR-N soils. Furthermore, dual-culture assays \ndemonstrated that Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Penicillium and Trichoderma isolates \ninhibited D. necatrix, highlighting their biocontrol potential. Key parameters, \nsuch as soil pH and iron (Fe), correlated strongly with microbial composition, \nsuggesting they play an important role in pathogen resilience.\nDISCUSSION: These findings underscore the complexity of the avocado rhizosphere \nand its role in managing WRR, offering a foundation for developing integrated \ndisease management strategies to enhance avocado productivity.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Magagula, Swart, Fourie, Vermeulen, Nelson, van Rooyen and van \nden Berg.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1583797\nPMCID: PMC12141342\nPMID: 40485830\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

To date, the \ncommunity composition and functional shifts of the rhizosphere microbiome in \ntobacco plants infected with Fusarium root rot remain poorly understood.\nMETHODS: In this study, we analyzed the differences in the compositions and \nfunctions of the bacterial and fungal communities in the rhizosphere and root \nendosphere of healthy tobacco plants and tobacco with Fusarium root rot using \namplicon sequencing and metagenomic sequencing.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results showed that Fusarium root rot disrupted the \nstability of bacteria-fungi interkingdom networks and reduced the network \ncomplexity. Compared to healthy tobacco plants, the Chao1 index of bacterial \ncommunities in the rhizosphere soil of diseased plants increased by 4.09% (P < \n0.05), while the Shannon and Chao1 indices of fungal communities decreased by \n13.87 and 8.17%, respectively (P < 0.05). In the root tissues of diseased \nplants, the Shannon index of bacterial and fungal communities decreased by \n17.71-27.05% (P < 0.05). Additionally, we observed that the rhizosphere \nmicrobial community of diseased tobacco plants shifted toward a pathological \ncombination, with a significant increase in the relative abundance of harmful \nmicrobes such as Alternaria, Fusarium, and Filobasidium (89.46-921.29%) and a \nnotable decrease in the relative abundance of beneficial microbes such as \nLysobacter, Streptomyces, Mortierella, and Penicillium (48.48-81.56%). \nMetagenomic analysis further revealed that the tobacco rhizosphere microbial \ncommunities of diseased plants played a significant role in basic biological \nmetabolism, energy production and conversion, signal transduction, and N \nmetabolism, but their functions involved in C metabolism were significantly \nweakened. Our findings provide new insights into the changes in and interactions \nwithin the rhizosphere and root endosphere microbiomes of tobacco plants under \nthe stress of Fusarium soil-borne fungal pathogens, while laying the foundation \nfor the exploration, development, and utilization of beneficial microbial \nresources in healthy tobacco plants in the future.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Yang, Cai, Bai, Han, Zeng, Liu, Liu, Liu, Ma and Yu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1512694\nPMCID: PMC12023262\nPMID: 40291803\n\nConflict of interest statement: YC, TB, RZ, DL, TL, RL, and CM were employed by \nQujing Branch of Yunnan Provincial Tobacco Company.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, \nparticularly regarding how distinct AMF species regulate the rhizosphere \nmicrobiome.\nRESULTS: Five AMF species (Funneliformis mosseae, Diversispora versiformis, \nClariodeoglous etunicatum, Rhizophagus intraradices, and Acaulospora delicate) \nwere inoculated to investigate their effects on tobacco seedling growth and \nrhizosphere microecological regulation. The results showed that all AMF \ninoculations significantly increased shoot and root biomass, N/P/K uptake, \nmorphological traits (height, stem diameter, leaf area), chlorophyll content \n(SPAD), and root architecture (length, surface area, volume, diameter) of \ntobacco seedlings. Among them, the treatment inoculated with R. intraradices \nshowed the most outstanding growth-promoting effect in all growth indicators. \nMetagenomic analysis indicated that AMF inoculation significantly altered the \ndiversity and community structure of rhizosphere substrate microorganisms. Among \nthem, R. intraradices inoculation yielded the highest microbial diversity, with \nan associated network exhibiting enhanced complexity. KEGG functional annotation \nrevealed metabolic pathways (IAA biosynthesis, iron-siderophore transport \nregulation, exopolysaccharide production, and nutrient cycling) consistently \nassociated with tobacco growth promotion in all AMF inoculations. However, \nspecies-specific mechanisms were observed: F. mosseae promotes tobacco seedling \ngrowth by enhancing IAA synthesis through the recruitment of beneficial \nmicroorganisms such as Nostoc, Flavisolibacter, Frateuria, and Sphingomonas. D. \nversiformis enhanced carbon fixation via the hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate \ncycle, driven by the proliferation of Glaciecola, Pedococcus, Phycicoccus, and \nHephaestia. C. etunicatum facilitated phosphorus/iron accumulation through \norganic phosphorus mineralization, phosphate transport, and iron acquisition \naccompanied by the recruitment of, Hartmannibacter, Lysobacter, Moheibacter, and \nPseudolabrys. R. intraradices improved nitrogen assimilation through augmented \nnitrogen transport and assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA), correlated with \nthe recruitment of Azospirillum, Sphingobium, Mesorhizobium, Paracoccus, and \nParafilimonas. A. delicate stimulated plant growth via polyphosphate degradation \nand exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, associated with the enrichment of \nSegetibacter, Ferruginibacter, Hyphomicrobium and Pseudomonas. Notably, this \nstudy revealed that functional divergence in rhizosphere microbiomes associated \nwith the five tested fungal species was primarily reflected in the abundance \nrather than the composition of functional genes.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, AMF inoculation significantly enhanced tobacco seedling \nbiomass and agronomic traits by improving mineral nutrient assimilation \nefficiency and restructuring the rhizosphere microbial community. Different AMF \nspecies exhibited distinct microecological regulation patterns.

While plant growth-promoting \nrhizobacteria (PGPR) demonstrate potential in enhancing plant salt tolerance, \ntheir precise mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This study \nsystematically investigates the mechanistic basis by which PGPR inoculation \nameliorates salt stress in rice seedlings through modulation of rhizosphere \nmicrobiota and root exudate profiles.\nMETHODS: We inoculated rice seedlings with five monocultures (Bacillus sp., \nProvidencia sp., etc.) and a synthetic consortium (T6) under salt stress \nconditions. Growth parameters, rhizobacterial communities (via 16S rRNA \nsequencing), and root exudates (untargeted metabolomics) were comparatively \nanalyzed against uninoculated controls (CK).\nRESULTS: PGPR inoculation significantly promoted rice seedling growth under salt \nstress. Treatments T2-T6 exhibited substantial increases in key biomass \nparameters-including root length, plant height, and dry weight-relative to the \nCK control. Concurrently, elevated chlorophyll content and enhanced \nphotosynthetic efficiency were observed. Inoculated plants also displayed \nsignificantly higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase, \nPeroxidase, Catalase activity) (SOD, POD, CAT) and proline (Pro) accumulation in \nboth leaves and roots, coupled with a marked reduction in Malondialdehyde, \nindicating effective mitigation of oxidative damage. PGPR inoculation altered \nrhizosphere bacterial community composition, reducing overall alpha-diversity. \nNotably, the relative abundance of dominant bacterial phyla (e.g., \nProteobacteria, Acidobacteriota) and beneficial genera (e.g., Subgroup_7, \nLysobacter) increased significantly. These microbial shifts showed positive \ncorrelations with improved plant physiological status, suggesting a synergistic \nrole in promoting seedling growth under salt stress. Root exudate metabolomics \nrevealed a substantial number of differentially abundant metabolites in \ninoculated plants compared to CK, encompassing lipids, hormones, and signaling \nmolecules. Crucially, the production of these specific exudates correlated with \nthe enrichment of dominant bacterial taxa in the rice rhizosphere. Metabolic \npathway analysis indicated significant enrichment primarily within Nucleotide \nmetabolism and Purine metabolism pathways (belonging to the Metabolism \nsuperclass) and ABC transporter pathways (within Environmental Information \nProcessing). The T6 consortium treatment induced enrichment across a \nsignificantly greater number of key metabolic pathways compared to single-strain \ninoculations.\nDISCUSSION: PGPR inoculation enhances rice seedling growth and salt tolerance \nby: (1) optimizing rhizosphere microbiota (enriching dominant phyla and \nbeneficial genera); (2) recruiting stress-mitigating microbial consortia; and \n(3) stimulating root exudates enriched in nucleotide/purine metabolism and ABC \ntransporters. The superior efficacy of the T6 consortium underscores the \nadvantage of synergistic microbial interactions. Collectively, these findings \nreveal plant-microbe-metabolite mechanisms underlying PGPR-mediated salt \ntolerance, providing a foundation for developing salinized soil remediation \nstrategies.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Wang, Gao, Yang, Zhang and Chen.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpls.2025.1661074\nPMCID: PMC12540319\nPMID: 41132927\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

To determine the key \ndrivers of this process and their vulnerability to climate change, the \nshort-term responses of these pioneering microbial communities also need to be \nelucidated. Here, we investigated how the taxonomic and functional structure of \nmicrobial communities, including viruses, changed over a 7-year period in an \nAntarctic glacier forefield. Using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics we \nassessed the influence of both abiotic and biotic factors on these communities. \nOur results revealed a highly heterogeneous bacteria-dominated microbial \ncommunity, with Pseudomonas as the most abundant genus, followed by Lysobacter, \nDevosia, Cellulomonas, and Brevundimonas. This community exhibited the capacity \nfor aerobic anoxygenic phototrophy, carbon and nitrogen fixation, and sulfur \ncycling, processes vital for survival in nutrient-poor environments. 52 \nhigh-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered, representing \nboth transient and cosmopolitan taxa, some of which were able to rapidly respond \nto environmental changes. A diverse and highly dynamic collection of lytic and \ntemperate viruses was identified across all samples, with high clonal viral \ngenomes typically detected in only one of the eight samples analyzed. \nMetatranscriptomic analyses confirmed the activity of lytic viruses, while \nprophage genomes featured much lower expression levels. Prophages appeared to \ninfluence host fitness through the expression of genes encoding membrane \ntransporters. Additionally, the abundance of genes linked to antimicrobial \ncompound synthesis and resistance, along with antiphage defense systems, \nhighlights the importance of biotic interactions in driving microbial community \nsuccession and shaping short-term responses to environmental fluctuations.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

However, their \nimpacts on soil bacterial communities and nutrient cycling in semi-arid \nAstragalus systems remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of \nMF and CF on soil properties and bacterial communities over two years, analyzing \n36 soil samples from two depths (0-20\xa0cm and 20-50\xa0cm). Bacterial composition \nwas determined using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing, and the relationships \nbetween microbial communities and soil properties were explored using network \nanalysis, Pearson correlations, and Mantel tests. Both amendments significantly \nimproved soil properties (p\xa0<\xa00.05), with the mean soil quality index (SQI) \nincreasing from 0.18 in the control to 0.50 with CF and 0.55 with MF. The \nrelative abundances of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota increased by 32-33\xa0% and \n8.6-10.8\xa0%, respectively, compared to the control. Average network modularity \nand density were higher in MF (0.64, 0.335) and CF (0.58, 0.34) compared to the \ncontrol (0.53, 0.32), indicating improved ecosystem resilience. Several genera, \nincluding Lysobacter, Nitrospira, and Pedobacter, showed positive correlations \n(p\xa0<\xa00.05) with key soil traits, suggesting their roles in nutrient cycling. Our \nresults demonstrate that manure and compost fertilization not only enhance soil \nquality and microbial diversity but also strengthen ecosystem resilience. These \nfindings suggest incorporating organic amendments, such as manure and compost, \nrather than chemical fertilizers, to enhance soil quality, promote sustainable \nagriculture, and support ecosystem stability in semi-arid farming systems.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Interactions and impact of house microbiome on the health of the \ninhabitants need to be clearly defined. Therefore, it is critical to understand \nthe diversity of the house microbiota, the presence and abundance of potential \npathogens, and antimicrobial resistance.\nRESULTS: Shotgun metagenomics was used to analyze the samples collected from 9 \nlocations in 10 houses in New Delhi, India. The microbiota includes more than \n1409 bacterial, 5 fungal, and 474 viral species en masse. The most prevalent \nbacterial species were Moraxella osloensis, Paracoccus marcusii, Microbacterium \naurum, Qipengyuania sp YIMB01966, and Paracoccus sphaerophysae, which were \ndetected in at least 80 samples. The location was the primary factor influencing \nthe microbiome diversity in the Indian houses. The overall diversity of \ndifferent houses did not differ significantly from each other. The surface type \ninfluenced the microbial community, but the microbial diversity on the cemented \nand tiled floors did not vary significantly. A substantial fraction of the \nbacterial species were potentially pathogenic or opportunistic pathogens, \nincluding the ESKAPE pathogens. Escherichia coli was relatively more abundant in \nbedroom, foyer, and drawing room locations. Analysis of the house microbiome \nantimicrobial resistome revealed 669 subtypes representing 22 categories of \nantimicrobial resistance genes, with multidrug resistance genes being the most \nabundant, followed by aminoglycoside genes.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first insight into the microbiomes of \nhouses in New Delhi, showing that these houses have diverse microbiomes and that \nthe location within the house significantly influences the microbiota. The \npresence of potential pathogens and a repertoire of antimicrobial resistance \ngenes reflect possible health risks, as these could lead to infectious disease \ntransmission. This study builds a framework for understanding the microbial \ndiversity of houses in terms of geographical location, environment, building \ndesign, cleaning habits, and impact on the health of occupants.\n\n© 2025.

To elucidate the mechanism underlying these \nmicrobial threats and develop targeted control strategies, this study analyzed \ndynamic microbial profiles of Hainan areca nuts during the processing stages. \nAlpha diversity analysis and total fungal counts (TFC) of Hainan areca nuts were \nmonitored during different processing stages. A significant increase in TFC \n(1.725\xa0±\xa00.046 Lg CFU/g) and diversity of fungal species was observed in the \nfinished product (FP), which might be attributed to manual operation and \nenvironmental exposure during the final processing stages. Ten strains of mold \nwith the highest TFC were isolated and further screened on the areca nut powder \nculture medium. Two dominant mold species were isolated and identified by \nphylogenetic analysis, and were demonstrated to be Aspergillus ruber and \nAspergillus ochraceus. Growth curves under varying water activities (Aw) \nindicated that the grows of two dominant mold species were inhibited at Aw of \n0.798 and 0.815, respectively. Reinoculation of these species in areca nut \nproducts (Aw 0.80) further demonstrated that reduced Aw significantly suppressed \ntheir growth rates. These results may critically contribute to the prediction \nand extension of the shelf-life of areca nut products.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed \nto determine fungal abundance, diversity, composition, diffusion, and \nvariability in aerosols in rabbit breeding environments. Twenty PM2.5 filter \nsamples were collected from five sampling sites (i.e. En5, In, Ex5, Ex15, and \nEx45) in a modern rabbit farm in Linyi City, China. Fungal component diversity \nat the species level was analyzed in all samples using third-generation \nsequencing technology. Results revealed that fungal diversity and community \ncomposition in PM2.5 significantly differed across different sampling sites, and \ndifferent pollution levels. The highest concentrations of PM2.5 and fungal \naerosols (i.e., 102.5\xa0μg/m3 and 18.8\xa0×\xa0103\xa0CFU/m3, respectively) were found at \nEx5, and these concentrations were found to decrease as the distance from the \nexit increased. However, no significant correlation was observed between the \ninternal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene abundance and overall PM2.5 levels, \nexcept for Aspergillus ruber and Alternaria eichhorniae. Although most fungi are \nnot pathogenic to humans, zoonotic pathogenic microorganisms that cause \npulmonary aspergillosis (e.g., Aspergillus ruber) and invasive fusariosis (e.g., \nFusarium pseudensiforme) were observed. The relative abundance of A. ruber was \nhigher at Ex5 than that at In, Ex15, and Ex45 (p\xa0<\xa00.01), and the relative \nabundance of the fungal species decreased with an increase in distance from the \nrabbit houses. Moreover, four potential novel strains of Aspergillus ruber were \ndiscovered, with 82.9%-90.3% of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences similar \nto those of reference strains. This study highlights the importance of rabbit \nenvironments as a source in shaping fungal aerosol microbial communities. To the \nbest of our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover the initial \ncharacteristics of fungal biodiversity and dispersion of PM2.5 in rabbit \nbreeding environments, contributing to infectious disease control and prevention \nin rabbits.\n\nCopyright © 2023 The Authors.

The topic is highly relevant in the indoor hospital environment \nwhere vulnerable patients are treated and healthcare workers are exposed to \nvarious pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes. Knowledge of the microbial \ncommunities in such settings will enable precautionary measures to prevent any \nhospital-mediated outbreak and better assess occupational exposure of the \nhealthcare workers. This study presents a baseline of the bacterial and fungal \npopulation of two major hospitals in Kuwait dealing with COVID patients, and in \na non-hospital setting through targeted amplicon sequencing. The predominant \nbacteria of bioaerosols were Variovorax (9.44%), Parvibaculum (8.27%), \nPseudonocardia (8.04%), Taonella (5.74%), Arthrospira (4.58%), Comamonas \n(3.84%), Methylibium (3.13%), Sphingobium (4.46%), Zoogloea (2.20%), and \nSphingopyxis (2.56%). ESKAPEE pathogens, such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, \nStaphylococcus, Enterococcus, and Escherichia, were also found in lower \nabundances. The fungi were represented by Wilcoxinia rehmii (64.38%), \nAspergillus ruber (9.11%), Penicillium desertorum (3.89%), Leptobacillium \nleptobactrum (3.20%), Humicola grisea (2.99%), Ganoderma sichuanense (1.42%), \nMalassezia restricta (0.74%), Heterophoma sylvatica (0.49%), Fusarium \nproliferatum (0.46%), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.23%). Some common and \nunique operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of bacteria and fungi were also \nrecorded at each site; this inter-site variability shows that exhaled air can be \na source of this variation. The alpha-diversity indices suggested variance in \nspecies richness and abundance in hospitals than in non-hospital sites. The \ncommunity structure of bacteria varied spatially (ANOSIM r 2 = 0.181-0.243; p < \n0.05) between the hospital and non-hospital sites, whereas fungi were more or \nless homogenous. Key taxa specific to the hospitals were Defluvicoccales, fungi, \nGanodermataceae, Heterophoma, and H. sylvatica compared to Actinobacteria, \nLeptobacillium, L. leptobacillium, and Cordycipitaceae at the non-hospital site \n(LefSe, FDR q ≤ 0.05).

Treatment \noptions are severely limited. Amikacin has historically been a mainstay of \ncombination treatment regimens. However, irreversible hearing loss and \nvestibular toxicity have led to a search for alternative agents. Apramycin is a \nnovel aminoglycoside currently in Phase I clinical trials that may offer lower \npotential for ototoxic and renal toxic side effects.\nOBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to compare apramycin's in vitro activity \nwith amikacin and other aminoglycosides against a large collection of M. \nabscessus clinical isolates, alone, and for apramycin and amikacin, in \ncombination with clofazimine or linezolid. We also examined activity against a \nmore limited collection of other rapidly growing mycobacteria.\nMETHODS: Analysis was performed using reference broth microdilution MIC testing, \ninkjet printer-assisted checkerboard assays, and time-kill assays.\nRESULTS: Against M. abscessus, the MIC50/90 for apramycin (2\u2005mg/L) was \none-eighth that of amikacin (16\u2005mg/L). Plazomicin was inactive, and organisms \nwere rarely susceptible to tobramycin. Synergy of either apramycin or amikacin \nwith clofazimine or linezolid was not detected by checkerboard assay. In \ntime-kill studies, clofazimine modestly increased activity of apramycin and, to \na lesser extent, amikacin. Apramycin and amikacin showed delayed bacterial \nkilling that either achieved or approached a bactericidal threshold. Apramycin \nwas similarly potent against other rapidly growing mycobacteria tested.\nCONCLUSIONS: Apramycin exhibits more potent in vitro activity against a diverse \nset of M. abscessus and other rapidly growing mycobacteria than currently \nrecommended aminoglycosides.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

The assay was designed with species-specific primers \ntargeting 5 key genes: 16S rRNA, RD9, ITS (internal transcribed spacer) \nregion-MAC, ITS region-MCAG, and mkan-rs12360. Its feasibility and lower limit \nof detection (LOD) were validated using 6 standard mycobacterial strains; \ndiagnostic accuracy was further assessed using 68 clinical isolates and 130 \nclinical sputum samples, with whole-genome sequencing and targeted \nnext-generation sequencing serving as the respective gold standards for isolates \nand sputum specimens. The multiplex PCR assay exhibited high specificity for the \ntarget genes and primers: for standard strains, the LOD ranged from 0.7 to 5.0 \npg/μL; for artificially simulated sputum samples, the LOD was 5.6 to 26.7 pg/μL \nfor single infections and 7.1 to 43.9 pg/μL for mixed infections. Against \nwhole-genome sequencing, the assay achieved 100% detection rate and accuracy for \nclinical isolates. When compared with targeted next-generation sequencing for \nclinical sputum samples, the detection rates for single infections of MTB, MAC, \nMCAG, and M kansasii were 26%, 75%, 56.5%, and 50%, respectively, with an \noverall detection rate of 51.2% and 100% diagnostic accuracy. This multiplex PCR \nassay enables rapid and accurate identification of major pathogenic mycobacteria \nin clinical isolates; however, its sensitivity limitations - evidenced by \nrelatively low detection rates in clinical sputum samples, especially mixed \ninfections - highlight the need for further optimization with more sensitive \nprobe-based technologies to enhance clinical applicability.\n\nCopyright © 2025 the Author(s).

This \nretrospective study evaluated the diagnosis and treatment of NTM skin infections \nat a primary care hospital in Shouguang City, a coastal region of China with \nhigh-risk occupational exposure to aquatic environments, from 2021 to 2022. We \nanalyzed 144 patients, using real-time PCR on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded \n(FFPE) tissue samples to validate empirical diagnoses based on clinical \nsymptoms, exposure history, and histopathology. Our results demonstrated a high \nconcordance (79.17%) between empirical and molecular diagnoses, confirming the \nreliability of the primary care hospital's diagnostic approach. Real-time PCR \nsuccessfully identified specific NTM species in a subset of cases, with \nMycobacterium marinum and Mycobacteroides abscessus being the most prevalent. \nEmpirical treatment with combination antibiotics (primarily clarithromycin and \nrifampicin) was highly effective, achieving a cure rate of 90.97%. This study \nhighlights the effectiveness of integrated clinical-histopathological assessment \nfor managing NTM infections in resource-limited settings and underscores the \nvalue of molecular techniques such as PCR in enhancing diagnostic precision and \nfacilitating retrospective research using archived FFPE samples.\nIMPORTANCE: This study addresses a critical gap in managing non-tuberculous \nmycobacterial (NTM) skin infections in resource-limited primary care settings, \nwith particular relevance to coastal regions like Shouguang, where occupational \nexposure to marine environments elevates infection risk. By validating empirical \ndiagnosis through molecular testing, we demonstrate that integrated \nclinical-histopathological assessment is a reliable method for identifying NTM \ninfections where advanced diagnostics are unavailable. Our adaptation of \nreal-time PCR to archived FFPE tissues provides a feasible model for \nretrospective species identification and research, overcoming key resource \nconstraints. The high documented cure rate with clarithromycin-rifampicin \nregimens provides practical treatment benchmarks for regions with similar \nepidemiological profiles. These findings offer immediate clinical value by: (i) \nreinforcing the reliability of empirical diagnosis in resource-limited contexts, \n(ii) establishing a practical pathway for molecular confirmation using stored \nsamples, and (iii) validating effective treatment protocols for high-risk \noccupational groups. As NTM incidence increases globally, this work equips \nprimary care systems with evidence-based strategies to improve diagnostic \naccuracy and patient outcomes in settings with high marine exposure while \nsimultaneously enabling future research through the utilization of existing \nbiospecimen repositories.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/jcm.01065-25\nPMID: 41230976"},

Initial therapy for pulmonary M. abscessus disease often consists of \na combination of intravenous agents, which may include intravenous omadacycline. \nThe physical compatibility of omadacycline with other intravenous agents used in \nthe treatment of pulmonary M. abscessus disease is unknown.\nMETHODS: Physical compatibility of omadacycline 1 mg/mL was assessed via actual \nY-site infusion with amikacin, azithromycin, cefoxitin, imipenem/cilastatin, and \nlinezolid. Assessments of the triple-agent combinations of omadacycline with \nlinezolid plus amikacin and imipenem/cilastatin plus amikacin were also \nperformed. As needed, agents were reconstituted with sterile water for injection \nand diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride injection to typical clinical \nconcentrations. Each combination was tested for compatibility using visual, \nlaser light scattering, microscopy, pH, and turbidity assessments. Samples were \ntaken from the start and end of a typical 30-minute omadacycline infusion and \nassessed immediately and again 2 hours after mixing. All experiments were \nperformed in triplicate.\nRESULTS: No physical incompatibility was demonstrated with any tested \ncombination of agents with any method at any time point. Results were consistent \nacross experiments.\nCONCLUSION: At clinical concentrations of agents used in the treatment of \npulmonary M. abscessus disease, omadacycline appears to be physically compatible \nin dual-agent combinations in Y-site infusion with amikacin, azithromycin, \ncefoxitin, imipenem/cilastatin, and linezolid, as well as in triple combinations \nof omadacycline plus imipenem/cilastatin and amikacin and omadacycline plus \nlinezolid and amikacin.\n\n© American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2025.\n\nDOI: 10.1093/ajhp/zxaf299\nPMID: 41223120'},

Emerging multidrug resistance to current \nantibiotics poses significant challenges for treatment of M. abscessus \ninfections. Thus, new antibiotics are needed, preferably ones that target new \nmicrobial pathways. Earlier, we examined the in vitro inhibitory activities of \nseveral gallium compounds, Ga(NO3)3, GaCl3, gallium meso-tetraphenylporphyrin \n(GaTP) and gallium nanoparticles (GaNP), against intra- and extracellular M. \nabscessus. We have previously shown that these gallium compounds function by \ndisrupting microbial iron/heme acquisition and utilization. Here, we explored an \nalternative therapeutic approach using gallium hematoporphyrin (GaHP), a toxic \nheme analogue. GaHP inhibited growth of clinical M. abscessus isolates, with \nMICs in range of 0.5 and 1\xa0μg/ml. GaHP was more active than rifampin against M. \nabscessus, showed synergism with clarithromycin, and induced ROS formation in M. \nabscessus. GaHP also inhibited biofilm formation of both smooth and rough M. \nabscessus colony morphotypes. GaHP also disrupted preformed biofilms by both M. \nabscessus morphotypes. Hence, GaHP could be a potential lead compound for \ndevelopment of anti-NTM agents that targets heme-metabolism of M. abscessus.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The \npresent study is the first to report an evaluation of shotgun metagenomic \nsequencing of microplastic-contaminated marine water and sediment samples from \nthe coastal shores of the Bay of Bengal, India, across a stretch of 25\xa0km, which \nhouses a plethora of ubiquitous and uncultured microbial biodiversity coexisting \nwith multitudinous human interventions. Illumina Nova sequencing 6000 suggested \nthe presence of 88,539 scaffolds of data containing 132,568 identified genes of \nmarine microorganisms. Taxonomic identification with the assistance of curated \nglobal databases ensued in the presence of Proteobacteria (53.12\xa0%), \nBacteroidetes (7.13\xa0%), Actinobacteria (5.87\xa0%), and miscellaneous (33.86\xa0%) in \nabundance. Azonexus hydrophillus, Mycobacteroides abscessus, and Acidaminobacter \nhydrogenoformans were identified in profusion from the sequenced samples of the \nstudy area. The adaptation, sustenance, and survivability in the presence of \nplastic pollutants confirm the presence of microplastic-degrading enzymes in the \nmicroorganisms. The functional annotations revealed 54.32\xa0% and 58.34\xa0% \nsimilarities in genes with KEGG and COG databases, revealing the heavy presence \nof inorganic and amino acid transport channels. Further metabolic profiling of \nthe identified novel microorganisms will assist in engineering the enhancement \nof microbial enzymes, such as cutinases, lipases, and esterases, leading to \nmicroplastic degradation activity. The present research work signifies the \nanalysis and documentation of native microbiota of the marine shores of the Bay \nof Bengal and their interactive potentialities with microplastic-contaminated \nanthropogenic environments.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Viruses accounted for \n0.4\xa0% of the relative abundance in the gut and 0.6\xa0% in lungs. Mycobacteroides \nabscessus was genetically identified in 10 individuals, although only 2 had \npositive cultures. Patients with higher levels of Pseudomonas filamentous phages \nhad negative cultures for P. aeruginosa. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii was \ndetected in all sputum samples, accounting for 0.25\xa0% of the metagenomic reads, \nwith further PCR-confirmation in 50\xa0% of subjects, including children. No \ncorrelation was found between SCFA and lung function or microbial composition. \nThe resistome of the fecal compartment was higher than that of the lungs, and a \ngreater abundance of SCFAs in the intestine was associated with poorer lung \nfunction.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with normal-mild lung function had higher alpha diversity \nin the respiratory microbiota; however, beta diversity in the stool was \nstatistically different compared with the group with poorer lung function. \nAlthough there were no differences in SCFA concentrations, butyrate-producing \nbacteria were more abundant in the sputum of the group with better lung \nfunction. In fecal samples, resistome to tetracyclines, glycopeptides, and \naminoglycosides predominated, whereas in sputum an enrichment of ARGs related to \ntetracyclines, beta-lactams, and macrolides was observed.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

The \nmethylation of As, which was evaluated as a possible detoxification mechanism to \nsolve this issue. In this study, we simulated Chinese rice wine fermentation \nunder laboratory conditions to explore As methylation behavior. The total As \ncontent of Chinese rice wine decreased by 68.6\xa0% after fermentation. As species \nwere transformed during fermentation; inorganic arsenic (iAs) was converted to \nmethylated As; iAs decreased by 73.29\xa0%, and the dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) \npercentage increased from 4.4\xa0% to 19.9\xa0%. We found that the As methylation gene \n(arsM) was ubiquitous in Chinese rice wine. Correlation analysis showed that \nphysicochemical properties determined arsM abundance and DMA content during \nfermentation. The microbial As methylation pathway was summarized based on the \nannotated As functional genes from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes \ndatabase. Higher relative abundances of glutathione S-transferase and arsC \npromoted the formation of more trivalent As substrates and further promoted \nmethylation behavior for As detoxification during fermentation. According to the \nmicrobial arsM contribution analysis, Mycobacteroides, Rhizopus, and \nJimgerdemannia were the primary As methylation microorganisms in Chinese rice \nwine. These results highlighted the specific As methylation process during \nfermentation, which could improve the control of As contamination in Chinese \nrice wines.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The assay was designed with species-specific primers \ntargeting 5 key genes: 16S rRNA, RD9, ITS (internal transcribed spacer) \nregion-MAC, ITS region-MCAG, and mkan-rs12360. Its feasibility and lower limit \nof detection (LOD) were validated using 6 standard mycobacterial strains; \ndiagnostic accuracy was further assessed using 68 clinical isolates and 130 \nclinical sputum samples, with whole-genome sequencing and targeted \nnext-generation sequencing serving as the respective gold standards for isolates \nand sputum specimens. The multiplex PCR assay exhibited high specificity for the \ntarget genes and primers: for standard strains, the LOD ranged from 0.7 to 5.0 \npg/μL; for artificially simulated sputum samples, the LOD was 5.6 to 26.7 pg/μL \nfor single infections and 7.1 to 43.9 pg/μL for mixed infections. Against \nwhole-genome sequencing, the assay achieved 100% detection rate and accuracy for \nclinical isolates. When compared with targeted next-generation sequencing for \nclinical sputum samples, the detection rates for single infections of MTB, MAC, \nMCAG, and M kansasii were 26%, 75%, 56.5%, and 50%, respectively, with an \noverall detection rate of 51.2% and 100% diagnostic accuracy. This multiplex PCR \nassay enables rapid and accurate identification of major pathogenic mycobacteria \nin clinical isolates; however, its sensitivity limitations - evidenced by \nrelatively low detection rates in clinical sputum samples, especially mixed \ninfections - highlight the need for further optimization with more sensitive \nprobe-based technologies to enhance clinical applicability.\n\nCopyright © 2025 the Author(s).

This study used \nwhole-genome sequencing to analyze genomic variations in seven serially \ncollected isolates from three Thai patients, distinguishing between persistent \ninfections and reinfections. Comparative analysis with 43 global isolates \nrevealed subspecies-specific genetic diversity and distribution patterns. Among \nThai isolates, two paired samples (P7.1-P7.2 and P15.1-P15.2) were persistent \ninfections (same clone), while two (P8.1-P8.2 and P15.2-P15.3) were reinfections \n(different clones). Genome-wide comparisons revealed depth distribution patterns \nand gene cluster variations among different clones, whereas minimal divergence \nwas observed within persistent infections. Although initial pan-genome analysis \nidentified unique genes in same-clone pairs (P7.1 vs. P7.2 and P15.1 vs. P15.2), \nfurther validation using raw read mapping confirmed these genes were not truly \nunique. Analysis of global isolates showed subspecies-specific genetic \nvariations. M. abscessus subsp. abscessus (MAB) and M. abscessus subsp. \nmassiliense (MMAS) exhibited distinct genotypically drug resistance profiles, \nwith unique core genes linked to adaptation and resistance mechanisms. STRING \nanalysis identified 42 unique core genes in MAB, with 11 gene interactions-truB, \nprmC_2, and aguA_2 showing the highest interaction scores. In contrast, MMAS had \n11 unique core genes with a single interaction between lgrD_4 and rnc. \nSubsequent validation using NCBI BLAST showed only fmt_2 and aguA_2 were truly \nunique to MAB.

Patients with signs of non-IBD colonic inflammation (N\u2009=\u200928) and \nhealthy subjects (N\u2009=\u200967) served as controls. A total of 480 16S profiles were \nanalyzed. The results were evaluated with multiple clinical and pathological \nparameters and potential confounders were considered. The study aimed to find \nmicrobial biomarkers specific to IBD and signatures of intestinal barrier \ndysfunction.\nRESULTS: Fecal α-diversity of IBD patients was reduced and Pseudomonas species \nwas significantly increased in the mucosa of IBD patients (Pseudomonas-positive \nmucosa [PSM positive], P value < .001, Mann-Whitney U test). Comparison of \nmatched stool and mucosa samples showed high abundance of Pseudomonas species in \ngut mucosa but not in fecal samples, especially in CD patients. Interestingly, \nin PSM positive, Paracoccus species, Bacteroides species, and Streptococcus \nspecies were more abundant. Importantly, the results were independent of disease \nseverity, histopathology, medication, and other metadata.\nCONCLUSIONS: The opportunistic pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas species is more \nprevalent in the gut mucosa of patients with IBD. This indicates a disruption of \nthe gut barrier with increasing mucosal colonization or invasion of the \nbacteria. The finding is independent of clinical metadata and confounders and \noccurs in new-onset IBD but not in non-IBD intestinal inflammation, which \nsuggests disease specificity.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Pseudomonas species together with other, mainly aerobic \nbacteria are increasingly present in the gut mucosa of patients with \ninflammatory bowel disease (IBD), indicating a barrier dysfunction caused by \nPseudomonas. This is not found in non-IBD intestinal inflammation, suggesting \ndisease specificity.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

It involves pronounced inflammation and angiogenesis, and \nrecurrence remains common despite advances in surgical management. Subclinical \nbacterial involvement has been hypothesized as a potential factor in these \nrecurrent cases. We aimed to determine whether bacteria are present in CSDH \nouter membranes and to define accompanying histological and transcriptomic \nchanges.\nMETHODS: A total of 39 Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded outer-capsule specimens \nfrom 19 patients (17 primary, 22 recurrent) underwent: (1) ultra-deep Nanopore \n16S rDNA profiling; (2) histomorphology with Gram staining, lipopolysaccharide \nimmunohistochemistry and quantitative immune-cell counts; and (3) RNA-seq of 3 \nmatched primary-recurrent pairs, followed by differential-expression and pathway \nanalysis.\nRESULTS: Gram staining revealed bacteria in 2 recurrent samples (5%) from a \nsingle patient, whereas lipopolysaccharide immunohistochemistry was negative in \nall cases. Notably, 16S rDNA sequencing detected bacterial DNA exclusively in \nrecurrent lesions (6 samples from 4 patients), with none in primary cases (P = \n.02, χ2 test). The identified bacterial genera included Staphylococcus, \nNeisseria, Prevotellamassilia, and Paracoccus. Histopathological evaluation \nshowed no significant differences in eosinophils, myeloperoxidase-positive \ncells, CD3-positive T-cells, or CD20- positive B-cells when comparing primary \nwith recurrent lesions, or infected to uninfected membranes. Unsupervised \nclustering of matched primary and recurrent CSDH samples revealed distinct \ntranscriptomic profiles, identifying 184 differentially expressed genes \n(including consistent Toll-like receptor 4 upregulation) and highlighting \npathways related to development, protein biosynthesis, and wound healing.\nCONCLUSION: These findings suggest that bacterial DNA is present in a subset of \nrecurrent CSDH, suggesting that bacteria could be involved in recurrences. \nFurther research with larger cohorts is needed to determine whether \nantimicrobial or anti-inflammatory strategies might help reduce recurrence.\n\nCopyright © Congress of Neurological Surgeons 2025.

This study aims to characterize the skin microbiome \ncommunities of young wrestlers and kickboxers in comparison with their \nnon-athlete age-peers.\nMETHODS: A total of 56 combat sport athletes (30 males and 26 females, mean age \n± SD = 18.2 ± 1.5 years) and 25 non-athlete youths (control group: 13 males and \n12 females, mean age ± SD = 19.8 ± 1.2 years) voluntarily consented to \nparticipate in the study conducted by our research team in 2023 and 2024. The \nskin microbiome analysis involved standardized sampling, DNA isolation, \nmolecular sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis, thus enabling detailed \ncharacterization and comparison of the skin microbial community in contact \nsports athletes and the control group.\nRESULTS: Our results revealed notable sexual dimorphism in the skin microbiome \ncomposition of youth. Males showed a higher relative abundance of bacterial \ngenera associated with nosocomial infections and respiratory diseases, while \nfemales had more skin inflammation- and infection-related genera (relative \nabundances in males vs. in females: Corynebacterium-12.0 vs. 7.2; \nLuteimonas-4.4. vs. 1.4; Paracoccus-8.8 vs. 5.0; Psychrobacter-6.3 vs. 4.4; \nCutibacterium-6.4 vs. 11.4; Kocuria-1.6 vs. 3.9; Micrococcus-5.8 vs. 8.5; \nPseudomonas-1.2 vs. 3.4; Streptococcus 3.3 vs. 6.2). We also found skin \nmicrobiome differences between athletes and non-athletes in both sexes: \nwrestlers, who experience frequent skin-to-skin contact and wear less covering \nsportswear, had microbiome profiles distinct from both kickboxers and \nnon-athletes (relative abundances in athletes vs. in non-athletes: \nPsychrobacter-7.3 vs. 0.4; Staphylococcus 9.5 vs. 18.5; predominance of genera \nby sports type: relative abundance of Cutibacterium and Streptococcus was higher \nin kickboxers, and relative abundance of Acinetobacter, Enhydrobacter, \nMicrococcus, and Enhydrobacter was higher in wrestlers). Bacteria linked to skin \ninfections (e.g., Aliterella, Arthrobacter, and Empedobacter) were present in \naround 30% of wrestlers and kickboxers but were absent in the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the heightened risk of skin infections in \ncontact sports and highlight the importance of regular microbiome monitoring and \nhygiene protocols among young athletes.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/sports13090288\nPMCID: PMC12473315\nPMID: 41003594\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing \ninterests.'},

The meibum from the \ncontralateral eye of patient with chalazion served as sample control (group 2), \nand healthy individuals served as negative control (group 3). The contents were \nalso plated using conventional culture techniques.\nRESULTS: Meibomian glands expressed thick turbid meibum in the area of chalazion \nin five out of seven eyelids. Contralateral uninvolved eyelids and healthy \ncontrol glands were expressible with clear meibum. The mean Schirmer I value was \n24.6±4.9\u2009mm. Lid margin and meibum microbiome profiling revealed significant \ndifferences between the patients (involved or uninvolved sides) and healthy \ncontrols. The predominant phyla were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota and \nActinobacteria in all three groups. Acinetobacter, Moraxella and Paracoccus were \nthe predominant genera in groups 1 and 2. Significant differences were noted in \nthe predominant genera between group 3 versus groups 1 and 2. Principal \ncoordinate analysis revealed overlap between groups 1 and 2, whereas group 3 had \na distinct cluster.

In this study, an effective strain, identified as \nParacoccus denitrificans XW1, was isolated and immobilized on wheat straw \nbiochar for simultaneous TC and NO3--N removal. Results demonstrated a \nsignificant enhancement in TC and NO3--N removal by biochar-immobilized XW1 \n(IB), with IB exhibiting 1.29 to 8.90-fold greater TC removal and 1.03 to \n2.57-fold higher NO3--N removal than free XW1 cells (FB) across varied \nenvironmental conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed that the enhanced TC \nremoval was predominantly adsorption-dependent, whereas NO3--N elimination was \nprimarily driven by biochar-facilitated biodegradation. Over five reuse cycles, \nIB sustained enhanced NO3--N removal (38.56% to 94.76%) but exhibited gradual TC \ndecline (67.22% to 12.80%) from adsorption saturation, while FB rapidly lost TC \ndegradation capacity within two cycles. Biochar promoted antioxidant enzyme \nproduction to mitigate oxidative stress induced by TC. Meanwhile, biochar \nstimulated extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) secretion, particularly \nhumic acid-like substances, which concurrently enhanced TC adsorption and \nfacilitated denitrification. Transcriptomics analyses further revealed that \nbiochar upregulated genes associated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, \nATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and quorum sensing in XW1, consequently \nenhancing energy metabolism, enzymatic detoxification, and bacterial \ncooperation. This synergy enabled the efficient simultaneous bioremediation of \nTC and NO3--N.

The concentration of \n6:2 FTCA was highest in the liver, then was in the intestine, gill, brain and \nmuscle. The result consistently indicated that liver was the primary site for \n6:2 FTCA biotransformation, subsequently intestine through in vivo and in vitro \nexperiments. 6:2 FTCA experienced similar biotransformation pathway in the liver \nand intestine and produced 6:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (6:2 \nFTUCA) and C4-C7 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) by removing HF, α- and \nβ-oxidation. The significant increase of CYP450 enzyme and the molecular docking \nresults demonstrated that CYP450 enzyme played a crucial role in 6:2 FTCA \ntransformation in the liver. However, in the intestine, beyond CYP450 enzyme, \nintestinal microbiota also participated the biotransformation of 6:2 FTCA, \nespecially the genera Paracoccus, Gemmobacter and Pelomonas, which could secrete \nmetabolic enzymes and abundance significantly increased after exposure to 6:2 \nFTCA.

However, whether \nand how microbes enhance the dissolution and oxidation of stibnite under \nanaerobic conditions remain poorly understood. This study used the facultative \nanaerobic antimony-oxidizing bacterium Paracoccus versutus XT0.6 to explore this \nunder anaerobic conditions. XT0.6 couples the anaerobic oxidation of dissolved \nSb(III) with denitrification, as indicated by shifts of antimony and nitrogen \nspecies. Interactions between XT0.6 and stibnite were conducted in closed \nsystems with varying initial levels of oxygen (0\u202f%, 6\u202f%, 12\u202f%, 18\u202f%) and aerobic \ncondition (21\u202f%). Results showed that XT0.6 inhibited the dissolution of \nstibnite and the release of Sb(III) within closed systems, regardless of the \ninitial oxygen levels. This contrasts with aerobic conditions, where XT0.6 \npromoted stibnite dissolution and Sb release. In anaerobic abiotic closed \nsystem, total Sb concentration (TSb) was 41.7\u202fmg/L with 16.8\u202fmg/L as Sb(III). \nThe presence of XT0.6 in the anaerobic closed system decreased TSb to 13.9\u202fmg/L \nafter day 3, with no Sb(III) detected. Similar patterns were observed in other \nclosed systems with varying initial oxygen levels. Under aerobic condition, \nXT0.6 fully oxidized the released Sb(III) to Sb(V), resulting in a final \nconcentration of 83.8\u202fmg/L, while the abiotic control had a TSb of 69.8\u202fmg/L \nwith 36.3\u202fmg/L as Sb(III). Light exposure enhanced chemical dissolution of \nstibnite (TSb 114.1\u202fmg/L) and Sb(III) oxidation anaerobically but had no \nnoticeable impact on microbial interaction with stibnite. As a semiconductor \nmineral, stibnite can generate reactive oxygen species upon light exposure, \nexplaining the enhanced dissolution. The microbial inhibition of stibnite \ndissolution may be attributed to a passivation layer containing S-O bonds formed \non the mineral surface by XT0.6 as demonstrated by XPS and SEM-EDS results. This \nstudy offers novel insights into the role of facultative anaerobic bacteria in \nantimony cycling, highlighting the importance of microbial-mineral interactions \nunder anaerobic conditions.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

There is limited understanding of \nphyllospheric microorganisms controlling N2O exchange. In this study, we \ndetermined the microbial potential for N2O consumption in aboveground vegetation \nin boreal forests. For this, we collected shoot samples from upland spruce \nforests in Finland and used a novel targeted metagenomics approach with a \nhybridization capture of gene-specific probes. Most of the samples contained \nnosZ genes, encoding the N2O reductase. Phylogenetic placement showed a \nsignificantly higher relative abundance (P\u2009<\u2009.01) of nosZ Clade I than nosZ \nClade II. Bacterial members such as Comamonadaceae, Hydrogenophaga, and \nParacoccus, which all harbor nosZ Clade I, were found in high relative abundance \nin the spruce shoots across the sites, suggesting they play a role in N2O \nconsumption capabilities in the spruce phyllosphere. Anoxic incubations, \nutilizing gas chromatography for N2O analyses, showed potential N2O consumption \nactivity across the spruce samples. The presence of nirK and nirS suggests \npotential for denitrification, possibly resulting in N2O production. Our finding \nprovides evidence of microbial communities in spruce canopies with potential for \nN2O exchange. Given the vast coverage of boreal forests globally, understanding \nthe role of phyllospheric microorganisms in N₂O exchange is crucial for \nimproving the accuracy of greenhouse gas models and enhancing climate prediction \nreliability.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

Genome mining \nhas revealed many predicted siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in \nbacterial genomes, however the structures of their siderophore products remain \nmostly undetermined. This limits our molecular-level understanding of how \nbacteria acquire iron, as well as how they interact with other taxa that may use \nthe same siderophores within bacterial communities. Here, we apply inverse \nstable isotope labeling (InverSIL) to rapidly connect predicted siderophore BGCs \nto their products. With InverSIL, bacteria are grown on 13C-substituted carbon \nsources and then fed predicted biosynthetic precursors at their natural isotopic \nabundance to identify BGC products by mass spectrometry, which removes issues \nwith the availability of isotopically substituted precursors. We use InverSIL to \ndetermine the structures of the siderophore products of predicted BGCs from the \nmethylotrophic genera Methylophilus and Methylobacterium, and the siderophores \nproduced by the opportunistic pathogen Chromobacterium violaceum, which were \npreviously shown to be essential for virulence yet remained structurally \nuncharacterized. We next use this approach to reveal the unexpected production \nof enterobactin by the genera Kushneria and Paracoccus, which was difficult to \npredict from genome sequences due to the distributed nature of the biosynthetic \ngenes within the genomes. Finally, we use InverSIL to discover new siderophores, \ncellulochelin A and B, from the cellulose-degrading plant symbiont Cellulomonas \nsp. strain Leaf334. These findings demonstrate the utility of InverSIL for \nfunctional BGC characterization and expand our molecular understanding of \nbacterial iron acquisition strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.1101/2025.11.05.686764\nPMCID: PMC12637720\nPMID: 41280040\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no \nconflicts of interest.'},

Despite its economic importance, almost nothing \nis known about its microbiome. Seeking to help fill this knowledge gap, in our \nstudy we investigated the bacteriome of the insect (larvae and adult) and coffee \nleaves by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. We found that at the phylum level \nPseudomonadota and Bacteroidota dominate. At the genus level, leaves were mainly \ndominated by Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium; the caterpillar were mainly \ndominated by Xanthomonas and Paracoccus; the adult moth were mainly dominated by \nAcinetobacter and Klebsiella. We estimate that the contribution to the \nbacteriome of adult moths comes from larvae, 50%, from leaves, 40%, and 10% from \nother sources. Several bacteria with the potential to degrade insecticides and \nsecondary plant compounds were found, which leads to the expectation that they \nmay help their hosts in resisting these toxic compounds.

Electronic address: alkhan@uh.edu.\n\nSilicates (Si) improve plant growth; however, how different types of silicate \nsources influence plant growth and rhizosphere microbiome remains underexplored. \nWe compare two Si types (pure and bioavailable silicic acid (Si) and mineral \nmagnesium silicate (MgSi)) applied to the soybean (Glycine max L.) rhizosphere \nto determine whether two silicate types (Si-types) differently impact plant \ngrowth, defense responses, and microbiome diversity and function during heat \nstress. Under heat stress, Si-type treatments improved biomass (86\xa0% with Si and \n82\xa0% with MgSi), reduced H₂O₂ (26\xa0% phyllosphere; 33\xa0% rhizosphere), and \nenhanced β-glucosidase activity (2.6-fold rhizosphere) compared to heat-only \ntreatment and increased Proteobacteria relative abundance from ∼65\xa0% (heat-only) \nto ∼74\xa0% in Si-type-treated rhizospheric soil. Si-types showed downregulation of \nheat shock transcription factors, suggesting regulatory defense effects during \nheat stress. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) analysis revealed significant \nbacterial shifts across the Si-treatments, with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes \nbeing the dominant phyla in the rhizospheric soil. Under heat stress, the core \nmicrobiome comprised 14 rhizosphere genera (including Pelomonas, Achromobacter, \nParacoccus, Nocardioides), whereas Pelomonas was the sole core root genus, and \nPelomonas puraquae core species in both compartments. MAGs analysis revealed \nSi-based shifts in microbial metabolic pathways and enrichment of auxin \nbiosynthesis in Si-treated roots during heat stress. Because MgSi supplies both \nMg and Si, effects observed with MgSi are interpreted as combined Si\xa0+\xa0Mg \neffects. In conclusion, both Si-types caused shifts in microbiome diversity and \nfunction, and impacted plant growth and defense responses under heat stress, \nproviding a foundation for improving thermotolerance in plants.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional \nenvironmental monitoring relies on particle counts and culture-based \ncolony-forming unit measurements. These indicators fail to capture much of the \ndiversity and provenance of airborne microbes because many taxa are \nnonculturable or require growth conditions not supported by standard culture \nmedia. Therefore, comprehensive DNA-based microbiome analysis is critical for \nevaluating microbial risks that conventional methods may overlook; however, such \nstudies remain limited in cleanroom settings. This study aimed to \ncomprehensively visualize the structure of airborne microbial communities in \ncleanroom environments and clarify microbial risks that cannot be fully captured \nby particle counts or culture-based methods.\nMETHODS: We collected airborne bacterial DNA from cleanrooms with environmental \nGrades B, C, and D using a high-volume air sampler. The DNA was extracted and \nanalyzed via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing targeting the V3-V4 regions. \nBioinformatic analysis was performed using the QIIME2 pipeline, and microbial \ndiversity was assessed using alpha and beta diversity indices. Abundant taxa \nwere categorized based on their likely origin (environment- or skin-derived), \nand their distributions were examined in relation to facility management \npractices.\nRESULTS: Analysis revealed the consistent detection of skin-associated bacteria, \nsuch as Cutibacterium and Corynebacterium, and environmental bacteria, including \nBacillus and Paracoccus, across all cleanroom grades. Alpha- and \nbeta-diversities exhibited no significant differences among the grades. However, \ntemporary and irregular increases in skin-derived bacteria indicated \noperator-related non-persistent contamination. This interpretation was supported \nby skewness and kurtosis analyses, which indicated occasional but noticeable \nshifts in microbial abundance, particularly in high-grade cleanroom \nenvironments.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the limitations of conventional \nculture-based monitoring and underscores the value of DNA-based approaches for \ncharacterizing airborne microbial communities in cleanrooms. The detection of \ntemporary increases in skin-associated bacteria indicates that operator-related \ncontamination can occur even under stringent environmental conditions. These \nfindings support the development of integrated monitoring strategies that can \ncapture both the composition and temporal fluctuations of airborne microbiota to \nenhance microbial risk assessment.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.reth.2025.10.019\nPMCID: PMC12616117\nPMID: 41244152\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no known \ncompeting financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared \nto influence the work reported in this paper.'}]},

Microbial communities have been \nshown to enhance plant resistance to abiotic stresses, such as drought and \nsalinity, and to mitigate the impact of phytopathogens. Traditional microbiome \nengineering approaches face challenges due to the complexity of microbial \ninteractions. To overcome these limitations, recent advances in transcriptomics \nand metataxonomics analyses enable the identification of microbiome-associated \nphenotypes, co-occurrence networks, and key host genes-microbiome interactions. \nWe present a novel framework combining co-occurrence network analyses and \ntranscriptome-microbiota correlations to identify keystone belowground \nmicroorganisms and host genes potentially involved in olive (Olea europaea L.) \ntolerance to Verticillium wilt, a devastating disease caused by the soil-borne, \nfungal vascular pathogen Verticillium dahliae Kleb. Our approach aims to \nidentify microbiome-regulating host genes and keystone bacteria and fungi that \ncould be instrumental as genetic and microbiological markers in olive breeding \nprograms.\nRESULTS: In the root endosphere, cultivars qualified as tolerant to Verticillium \nwilt of olive (VWO) exhibited an enrichment of the bacterial genera \nActinophytocola, Kibdelosporangium and Nocardia. Keystone taxa analyses revealed \nclearly different profiles when comparing the microbial co-occurrence networks \nof the VWO-tolerant genotypes with those varieties described as susceptible to \nV. dahliae. Thus, tolerant cultivars harbored bacteria predominantly displaying \nnegative interactions with the mycobiome. In contrast, VWO-susceptible cultivars \ndisplayed microbial hubs with positive fungal correlations. Transcriptomic \nanalyses of olive roots identified 1,143 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), \nwith 309 upregulated genes in tolerant cultivars, highlighting biological \nprocesses like defense response, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid \ntransport. Key microbial taxa (Actinophytocola, Kibdelosporangium, Nocardia, \nAquabispora, and Fusarium) strongly correlated with DEGs associated with plant \ndefense.\nCONCLUSIONS: Keystone microbial taxa, particularly Actinophytocola and Nocardia, \nare proposed to play an important role against V. dahliae within the indigenous \nolive root microbiota under natural conditions. Moreover, our findings \nunderscore the importance of studying keystone taxa along with essential host \nplant genes to holistically understand plant-microbiota interactions and explore \ntheir potential in disease management. This integrative approach provides \ninsights into the complex dialogue taking place between the host plant and its \nmicrobiota, offering potential targets for microbiome engineering to enhance \nolive resilience against VWO.

We have isolated 13 distinct bacteria using \nculture dependent method. The bacteria were grown in a suitable media after \npurification and bioassay. Different extraction, chromatography and \nspectroscopic analyses such as TLC and HPLC chromatography and LC-MS, UV, and \nNMR were applied for purification and characterization of the metabolites \nsecreted from the bacteria in their media. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity of \nthe Streptomyces isolates was evaluated against HCT-116 human cancer cell lines \nby MTT assay.\nRESULTS: The isolated bacteria belonged to Streptomyces, Bacillus, \nMicromonospora, Pseudomonas and Nocardia genera. The ethyl acetate (EtOAc)- \nculture media extracts of all Streptomyces isolates were cytotoxic against \nHCT-116, the human colon carcinoma cells, exhibited IC50s of 27.4 to 134.9 µg. \nmL-1. Gene sequences of 16S rRNA was used for phylogenetic analysis which \nrevealed that Streptomyces coelicolor; strain WAK 9 as a different lineage along \nwith other potent strains. Hexane, dichloromethane (DCM) and aqueous methanol \n(MeOH) fractions of the EtOAc extract of WAK 9 strain's culture media were \ncytotoxic against HT29 cell lines with IC50s of 0.8-37.8 µg. mL-1. Chemical \nanalyses of the DCM and aqueous MeOH fractions of WAK 9 extract as the most \npotent strain resulted in the purification and characterization of two cytotoxic \nisoflavonoids, daidzein (1) and genestein (2), together with an unsaturated \nlactone containing compound; 5-(6-methyl-7-oxooctyl) furan-2(5H)-one \n(Butenolide, 3). On the other hand, eight volatile constituents, including four \nsesquiterpenoids; davanone (4), cis- and trans-isolongifolanone (5, 6) \neremoligenol (7) and a labdane diterpenoid (8) together with 3 n-alkanes were \nidentified by GC-MS from n-hexane fraction of the above-mentioned bacterial \nstrain. The heat shock protein (HSP) 90-beta was predicted as the possible \ntarget of compounds 5 and 6 cytotoxicity, and their interactions were evaluated \nusing molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation.\nCONCLUSION: Among 13 different bacterial isolates, four Streptomyces strains \nwere cytotoxic thus selected for further biological and chemical analyses. The \nWAK 9 strain was different from other strains based on its HPLC. Since WAK 9 was \nmolecularly separated from the others and had the highest cytotoxic properties \namong tested strains and for the presence of the rare terpenoids (4-8), and the \nbutenolide (3) this strain may be interesting for further investigations.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunts \ncarry the risk of several complications, from mechanical shunt failure and \ninfection to rarer complications such as abdominal pseudocysts. Skin flora has \nbeen found to be the cause of most ventriculoperitoneal shunt-related \npseudocysts. In this case presentation, we describe what we believe to be the \nfirst reported case of Nocardia species-induced ventriculoperitoneal \nshunt-related abdominal pseudocyst.\nCASE REPORT: A 27-year-old white male with a past medical history of cerebral \npalsy, congenital seizures, and hydrocephalus treated with four separate \nventriculoperitoneal shunts presented to the emergency department for abdominal \npain and distension for several months. A computed tomography scan of the \nabdomen showed a 6.1\xa0cm\u2009×\u200910.7\xa0cm\u2009×\u200914\xa0cm thinly encapsulated fluid collection \ncontaining the peritoneal ends of the ventriculoperitoneal shunts, which was \nindicative of an abdominal pseudocyst. Percutaneous aspiration of the pseudocyst \nfluid grew Nocardia paucivorans. The patient had no history of \nimmunosuppression. The patient underwent externalization of All the shunts along \nwith pseudocyst drainage. Antibiotic therapy was guided by the infectious \ndisease team. Daily cerebrospinal fluid samples were sent until three \nconsecutive cultures demonstrated no growth. The patient later underwent \nrevision of the shunt systems with placement of the distal catheters into the \npleural cavities. He was discharged on oral Bactrim and scheduled for a 4-week \nfollow-up in the neurosurgery clinic and the infectious disease clinic. We \nconducted a systematic review that yielded a total of 27 articles. Our case \nrepresents the first case of a Nocardia-infected abdominal pseudocyst associated \nwith a ventriculoperitoneal shunt that has been reported in literature.\nCONCLUSION: Abdominal pseudocysts are a rare complication of \nventriculoperitoneal shunt placement and can be associated with an underlying \nshunt infection. We present the first reported case of a Nocardia-infected \nabdominal pseudocyst associated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The patient \nwas successfully treated with shunt revision and antibiotic treatment. This case \nraises awareness that, in rare cases, uncommon central nervous system pathogens \ncan cause abdominal sequelae in the setting of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.\n\n© 2025.

Case report of subcutaneous tissue infection by \nNocardia brasiliensis in an immunocompetent host.\n\nda Silva SF(1), Baesso UD(1), Hipólito JR(2), Neto Junior JM(2), Bastos AN(1), \nWatanabe ASA(1), Machado ABF(1), Diniz CG(1), Da Silva VL(1), Dias VC(1).\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Department of Parasitology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Federal University \nof Juiz de Fora, Juiz de Fora, Brazil.\n(2)Cortes Villela Laboratory, Juiz de Fora, Brazil.\n\nBACKGROUND: Nocardia spp. are Gram-positive, acid-fast, aerobic bacteria that \ntypically affect immunocompromised individuals, primarily involving the \nrespiratory tract and central nervous system, though skin dissemination may \noccur. Cutaneous nocardiosis is rare and often misdiagnosed.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 57-year-old Brazilian man, \nimmunocompetent, who presented with a pustular lesion, cellulitis, and ascending \nlymphangitis on his right leg. His work in plant cultivation and public \nsanitation suggested environmental exposure. Sporotrichosis was initially \nsuspected, and empirical treatment with itraconazole and cefuroxime was \ninitiated. Bacterial cultures were negative, but fungal cultures revealed an \nacid-fast organism identified by MALDI-TOF as Nocardia brasiliensis. Treatment \nwas switched to sulfamethoxazole. The patient showed complete lesion resolution \nwithin 30\u2009days, without scarring. Therapy was maintained for two additional \nmonths, leading to full recovery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous nocardiosis may mimic other subcutaneous infections like \nsporotrichosis, delaying accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Clinical \nsuspicion, coupled with laboratory confirmation, is essential for correct \nmanagement. The use of MALDI-TOF facilitated precise identification of N. \nbrasiliensis, underscoring the importance of specialized microbiological tools. \nIntegrating clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data is crucial for the \ndiagnosis and successful treatment of rare infections such as lymphocutaneous \nnocardiosis.\n\nPlain Language Summary: Nocardia is a type of bacteria that usually causes \ninfections in people with weakened immune systems. These infections most often \naffect the lungs or brain. In rare cases, Nocardia can also infect the skin, \nwhere it is difficult to recognize and may be mistaken for other diseases.We \nreport the case of a 57-year-old man from Brazil who was otherwise healthy and \nnot immunosuppressed. He developed a painful skin lesion on his right leg, with \nswelling and red streaks (lymphangitis). Because of his work with plants and \nwater, and the appearance of the wound, doctors initially suspected \nsporotrichosis, a fungal infection.The patient began treatment with antifungal \nand antibiotic medications. However, laboratory tests did not identify common \nfungi or bacteria. A specialized molecular test later revealed Nocardia \nbrasiliensis, a rare cause of skin infection, especially in healthy individuals. \nHis treatment was switched to sulfamethoxazole, the appropriate antibiotic. \nAfter one month, the lesion healed completely without leaving scars. He \ncontinued therapy for two more months and achieved full recovery.This case \nhighlights how rare infections such as nocardiosis can resemble more common \ndiseases, delaying diagnosis and treatment. Rapid, accurate testing is essential \nto ensure the correct diagnosis. Clinicians should consider Nocardia as a \npossible cause of skin infections, even in patients without immune problems.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/17460913.2025.2583026\nPMID: 41195951'}],

Nocardia strains generally exhibited high resistance to \nclarithromycin, clindamycin, and isoniazid. Clinical and reference strains of N. \nfarcinica and N. otitidiscaviarum were susceptible to amikacin and linezolid. \nAmoxicillin-clavulanate and imipenem were effective against all clinical and \nreference strains of N. farcinica, whereas gentamicin was effective against all \nclinical and reference strains of N. otitidiscaviarum.\nCONCLUSIONS: Linezolid and amikacin were the most consistently active drugs \namong the analyzed species.

Beyond surgical intervention, the identification of \npathogens is key to clinical antimicrobial therapy, yet this remains a \nchallenge. Nocardia is a ubiquitous bacterium that typically manifests as an \nopportunistic infection, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals. \nPulmonary involvement, characterized by suppurative inflammation, commonly \noccurs following inhalation, with subsequent hematogenous dissemination \npotentially leading to widespread infection. To our knowledge, central nervous \nsystem (CNS) infection by Nocardia asiatica (N. asiatica) resulting in brain \nabscess has hitherto rarely been reported. We present a rare case of multiple \nbrain abscesses caused by N. asiatica co-infection with Torque teno virus (TTV) \nin an immunocompetent patient with suspected multiple organ involvement. The \npatient was admitted to our hospital, presenting with a headache, and imaging \nrevealed brain abscess-like lesions. A robot-assisted stereotactic puncture and \ndrainage were used for abscess removal. N. asiatica and TTV were identified by \nmetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the brain abscess aspirate, \nwith N. asiatica subsequently confirmed by mass spectrometry of the cultured \norganism. A disseminated Nocardia infection was suspected based on the patient\'s \nskin trauma history, pulmonary inflammatory changes, and imaging findings (liver \ncysts, subcutaneous nodules). However, etiological confirmation was not obtained \nprior to his death. While this is not the first reported instance of Nocardia \nand TTV co-infection in brain abscesses, our case is notable for its occurrence \nin an immunocompetent patient. This report highlights the significance and value \nof TTV in the context of brain abscesses and warrants a re-evaluation of \nNocardia and TTV co-infection. Given that the diagnosis of intracranial \ninfection depends on the detection of pathogens, we advocate for the routine and \nearly implementation of mNGS testing in patients with brain abscesses. Moreover, \nsystemic nutritional support and immunomodulatory therapies should be considered \nin the early stage of treatment for complex cases. Earlier diagnosis and \ntreatment in this case might have altered the patient\'s outcome.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Huang, Ran, Zhang, Yang, Yin, Lv, Liu and Pei.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmed.2025.1661345\nPMCID: PMC12646876\nPMID: 41312456\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

Microbial community structure and function were compared using \nstatistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, and pathway prediction with \nPICRUSt2.\nRESULTS: Patients with OSCC exhibited significantly different microbial \ndiversity and composition compared to controls. The genera Rhodococcus, Slackia, \nLactobacillus, and Enterobacterales_g were enriched in the OSCC group, whereas \nCorynebacterium was more abundant in the Control group. These taxa were \nassociated with oncogenic pathways, including PI3K-Akt signaling and \nnicotinate/nicotinamide metabolism. Functional inference also indicated \nenrichment of cancer-related orthologs such as LKB1, NFKB1, ITGAV, and TRAF4.\nCONCLUSIONS: Salivary microbiome alterations, both taxonomic and functional, are \nassociated with OSCC in never-smoking females. These findings suggest a \npotential microbial contribution to carcinogenesis in this unique patient \npopulation and offer novel insights into disease mechanisms.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

However, \nthe mechanism of action of FHT remains unclear.\nPURPOSE: In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the targeted regulation \nof intestinal flora by Fangji Huangqi Tang to delay CKD.\nMETHOD: A CKD model was established in rats and mice by tail vein injection of \ndoxorubicin, and the rats and mice were administered FHT orally. Metagenomic \nsequencing analysis was employed to screen and identify FHT-regulated key gut \nbacteria in CKD model rats and mice. In vitro bacterial co-cultures of these \ntaxa were analyzed for metabolite discovery. Oral supplementation of key \nbacteria in CKD mice was evaluated the therapeutic effects and validated the \nmetabolic changes observed in vitro. Cellular Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) \noverexpression was conducted to clarify the mechanistic of the metabolite \nderived from microbiota.\nRESULTS: FHT significantly enriched Corynebacterium stationis (C. stationis) in \nboth CKD rat and mice models. In vitro, C. stationis metabolized tryptophan into \nIndole-3-Carbinol (I3C) while reducing indole levels. Oral administration of C. \nstationis in CKD mice attenuated renal dysfunction and elevated systemic I3C. \nAdditionally, it downregulated AHR expression and diminished the expression of \nROS-related inflammatory factors, thereby ameliorating CKD. Crucially, AHR \noverexpression reversed I3C's cytoprotective effects in MPC5 injury models.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that FHT targets the enrichment of the gut \nbacterium C. stationis, driving tryptophan metabolism toward I3C conversion. \nThis process suppresses AHR expression, reduces ROS levels and inflammatory \ninjury, and ultimately retards the progression of CKD.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

Currently, studies have examined EGT \nimport systems and its physiological roles in various organisms. Despite the \nbroad applicability of EGT, industrial production with high productivity has not \nyet been achieved. In this study, we aimed to develop fermentative production \nmethods for EGT using Corynebacterium glutamicum as a host and successfully \nachieved the highest yield of EGT (459 mg L-1) reported to date. A \ncysteine-producing strain C. glutamicum CYS-2, which was constructed in a \nprevious study, was engineered to enhance the biosynthesis of histidine and \nS-adenosylmethionine, both of which, along with cysteine, are required for EGT \nproduction. Additionally, heterologous metabolic pathways for EGT biosynthesis \nfrom Mycolicibacterium smegmatis and Methylobacterium pseudosasicola were \nintroduced into the engineered strain, which was designated CHS2. In batch \ncultivation, the CHS2 strain produced more EGT than the CYS-2 strain harboring \nthe same EGT biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly, batch cultivation of the CHS2 \nstrain under high osmotic pressure conditions prolonged the time for EGT \nproduction and increased the intracellular accumulation of EGT. These results \nsuggest that increasing osmotic pressure together with engineering the \nbiosynthesis of cysteine, histidine, and S-adenosylmethionine is an effective \nstrategy for enhancing EGT production in recombinant C. glutamicum harboring \nheterologous EGT biosynthesis pathways. KEY POINTS: • Ergothioneine production \nin C. glutamicum was enhanced by metabolic engineering. • Osmotic pressure \naffects ergothioneine production in engineered C. glutamicum. • Ergothioneine \nmay function as a compatible solute in C. glutamicum.\n\n© 2025.

In this study, coarse (SPM-PM2.5) and fine (PM2.5) particles were \ncollected from suburban and urban, with bacterial communities and 48 chemical \ncompositions. The results showed that PM mass concentrations in Yokohama (urban, \nSPM-PM2.5 =\xa05.6\u202fμg/m3; PM2.5 =\xa011.8\u202fμg/m3) were higher than those in Toyama \n(suburban, SPM-PM2.5 =\xa03.8\u202fμg/m3; PM2.5 =\xa09.4\u202fμg/m3), but values remained below \nJapan\'s environmental standard. Water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) and \nCarbonaceous species (CS) were the dominant chemical compositions, accounting \nfor 65.6\u202f%-72.4\u202f% of the total PM mass. Potential ecological risk (RI) reached a \n"serious" level at both sites (Toyama: 4839.6; Yokohama: 5443.4), with Sb as the \ndominant contributor (Ei = 701.1 and 832.7, respectively), indicating that \nmetal-enriched fine particles may exert ecological pressure even when PM mass \nremains within regulatory limits. Microbial community analysis indicated a \npredominance of plant-associated bacteria such as Methylobacterium (18.9\u202f%) and \nSphingomonas (7.8\u202f%) in Toyama. Yokohama, by contrast, were dominated by \nhuman-associated microorganisms including Corynebacterium (9.5\u202f%) and \nStreptococcus (6.4\u202f%). Co-occurrence network and redundancy analysis (RDA) \nfurther indicated that Yokohama\'s PM2.5 network had 2.8 times higher modularity \nthan Toyama\'s and was mainly driven by As, Pb (representing combustion and \nindustrial source elements, CSE), and elemental carbon (EC), while Toyama was \nprimarily influenced by Fe, K, and Rb (representing sea salt and crustal source \nelements, SCE).

Built environment surveillance can provide a non-invasive indicator of \nSARS-CoV-2 status in hospitals, but we have a limited understanding of \nSARS-CoV-2's microbial co-associations in the built environment, including any \npotential co-occurrence dynamics with pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant \nmicroorganisms. Here we examine the microbial communities on floors and elevator \nbuttons across several locations in two major tertiary-care Ontario hospitals \nduring a surge in SARS-CoV-2 cases in 2020. Total microbial community \ncomposition, prevalence and type of detected antimicrobial resistance genes, and \nvirulence factor distributions were governed by sample source rather than \nSARS-CoV-2 detection status. Fifteen microorganisms were identified as indicator \nspecies associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 signal, including three \nopportunistic pathogens (i.e., two Corynebacterium sp. and a Sutterella sp). Key \nclinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes showed varying prevalence \nacross sites within the hospital, suggesting that our workflow could inform \nresistance burden in hospitals. Overall, these results indicate limited or only \nweak interactions between microbiome composition and SARS-CoV-2 detection status \nin the hospital built environment.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 George et al.

This study aimed to compare the outcomes of single-stage versus \ntwo-stage revision and to identify clinical or demographic factors associated \nwith treatment failure.\nMETHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at a single tertiary \nhospital including 29 patients treated for shoulder PJI between 2010 and 2023. \nPatients underwent either one-stage (n\u2009=\u200915) or two-stage (n\u2009=\u200914) revision \naccording to clinical and microbiological criteria, and the final choice of \nsurgical strategy (one-stage vs. two-stage revision) was made at the discretion \nof the attending surgeon. The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as \ninfection eradication without further surgery or suppressive antibiotics. \nSecondary outcomes were pain and functional results measured with the \nConstant-Murley Score (CMS), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Visual \nAnalog Scale (VAS). A standard statistical analysis was performed comparing \nbaseline data of both groups and finding factors related to the primary outcome.\nRESULTS: Baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable. Overall \ninfection control was achieved in 83% of patients, nonetheless, the one-stage \ngroup showed a higher success rate compared with the two-stage group (93% vs. \n71%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance \n(p\u2009=\u20090.169; OR:0.19(0.003,2.29)). Functional outcomes assessed by CMS and VAS \ndid not differ significantly between groups, whereas SST scores were \nsignificantly better following one-stage revision (p\u2009=\u20090.006). Increased BMI and \na higher number of previous surgeries tended to be associated with treatment \nfailure.\nCONCLUSION: Single-stage revision achieved comparable infection control and \nbetter functional outcomes than two-stage revision, supporting its role as a \nreliable surgical option for shoulder PJI in appropriately selected patients, \nalthough it could be influenced by bias selection.\n\n© 2025.

China, 200011.\n\nBACKGROUND: Capsular contracture (CC) is one of the most common complications in \naugmentation mammaplasty with breast implant, but its etiology remains \nuncertain. We aimed to apply the 2bRAD-M technique to characterize the \nmicrobiome differences between normal and contracture capsules.\nMETHODS: 10 normal capsules and 10 contractured capsules were used for 2bRAD-M \nsequencing and corresponding histological evaluation. By constructing a mouse \nsilicone implant infection model, histological staining was used to verify the \ninfluence of different microorganisms identified in sequencing results.\nRESULTS: Histologic evaluation of patient samples revealed a marked increase in \nthe thickness and stiffness of contracture capsules, along with increased \ninfiltration of macrophages and T cells. Through 2bRAD-M sequencing, we found \nthat the microbial composition of contracture capsules was significantly \ndifferent from that of normal capsules, with the most significant difference of \nrelative abundance value in Ralstonia pickettii. In vivo, Ralstonia pickettii \ncould significantly increase the thickness, collagen content, and hardness of \nthe capsules, which was more effective than the combined infection with \nStaphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium acnes. Immunofluorescence results \nshowed both bacterial infections caused increased infiltration of macrophages \nand T cells, and Ralstonia pickettii infection caused more infiltration of T \ncells.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to use 2bRAD-M technique to characterize \nmicrobiome differences of relative abundance value between normal and \ncontracture capsules. Ralstonia pickettii can recruit more macrophages and T \ncells to infiltrate. This study provides new etiological causes of capsular \ncontracture and new clinical insights for the prevention and treatment of \ncapsular contracture.\n\nCopyright © 2025 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nDOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000012570\nPMID: 41351228\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing interests: The authors of this article \naffirm that they are not involved in any conflicts of interest."},

However, recent reports have documented cases of infections \noccurring after PRP therapy. In this study, we aimed to examine potential \nmicrobial contamination risks associated with PRP therapy and evaluate rapid \nmicrobial detection methods suitable for clinical use.\nMETHODS: We assessed the risk of microbial contamination during blood \ncollection, PRP preparation, and sterility testing. To evaluate suitable \ndetection methods, we compared the microbial detection sensitivities of flow \ncytometry (FCM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identifying microbial \ncontamination in PRP. For this purpose, PRP samples were inoculated with \nStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Cutibacterium acnes, Micrococcus \nspp., Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans.\nRESULTS: Following skin disinfection, microbial colonies were detected at the \nvenipuncture site in six out of ten patients. Environmental monitoring \nidentified airborne microbial colonies in two out of three anonymous PRP \npreparation facilities. Sterility tests revealed negative results for all 85 \nresidual PRP and 15 platelet-poor plasma (PPP) cases. FCM sensitivity for \nmicrobial detection in PRP was effective at a concentration of 102-103 colony \nforming units (cfu)/mL or higher. While C. albicans could not be detected \nseparately from non-specific PRP signals using FCM, it was detectable in PPP at \n≥102\xa0cfu/mL. PCR sensitivity for microbial detection was excellent when \nanalyzing pure microbial suspensions, however, it yielded a high rate of \nfalse-negative and false-positive results when PRP samples contained certain \nmicrobial strains.\nCONCLUSION: The risks of microbial contamination were identified during both \nvenipuncture and PRP production. To reduce these risks, it may be necessary to \nimprove disinfection protocols for venipuncture sites and blood collection \nmethods, implementing appropriate facility-specific measures. Although requiring \nfurther detection sensitivity improvements, FCM is a promising method for \ndetecting viable bacteria in PRP. Given that microbial contamination cannot be \ncompletely eliminated, clinicians providing PRP therapy should remain alert to \nthe potential for postoperative infections and ensure appropriate follow-up \nprotocols are established.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.reth.2025.11.008\nPMCID: PMC12666433\nPMID: 41333320\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare the following financial \ninterests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing \ninterests: Morikuni Tobita reports financial support was provided by AMED. \nYoshitomo Saita reports financial support was provided by AMED.

This study aims to investigate dry skin \ncondition and microbiota then the efficacy of a novel skincare formulation \n(Nourish 3-Biotic Rich Serum) containing prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics \nin addressing dry skin symptoms and rebalancing skin microbiota. They are mainly \nmicroorganism lysate, together with fermented substances such as \noligosaccharides, enzymes, and peptides, that support and provide nourishment to \nbacteria that live on the skin.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum formula and serum placebo were tested in a \nsingle-blind study in which 20 female volunteers aged 28-65 with dry skin were \nenrolled. Several skin biophysical parameters related to skin barrier condition \n(stratum corneum water content, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), protein \ncontent), mechanical properties (R0, R2) and topographic appearance (skin \nroughness) and skin microbiota analysis were monitored over 30\u2009days of daily \napplication of the products in a split-face protocol. To better understand the \nresults, the selected panel was then divided into two groups based on different \nages: younger (<\u200950\u2009years) and older (>\u200950\u2009years).\nRESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This study highlighted that the product has proven to \nhave a moisturizing action, exerts a cellular renewal action, improves skin \nfirmness and elasticity, and reduces skin roughness. For microbial analysis, the \nmain evidence is that both the placebo and the product help restore the skin \nmicrobiota but only the product increased the quantity of Cutibacterium acnes \n(one of the primary commensal bacteria of the skin) and was able to decrease the \nabundance of Pseudomonas koreensis usually associated with dry and rosacea skin \nwith beneficial effects.\n\n© 2025 Medspa S.R.L and The Author(s).

This study aimed to address this knowledge gap.\nMETHODS: A case-case-control study of adults with monomicrobial Cutibacterium \nacnes infections (CaIs) following nonspine neurosurgical procedures (2016-2024) \n(Cases I). These were individually matched (1:1:1) by age, year, and procedure \ntype to individuals who did not develop infection (controls) and to individuals \nwith aerobic bacterial infections (abIs; cases II). Multivariable conditional \nlogistic regression models were implemented to assess clinical correlates for \ninfection by either bacterial group, clinical presentation, and outcomes \ndifferences.\nRESULTS: Cutibacterium acnes isolation predominantly reflected contamination \n(131/213, 62%), and ultimately 32 (15%) CaIs cases were included. Smoking \n(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-9.97) was the \nonly independent risk factor identified for CaIs. In contrast, nonelective \nprocedure was identified as an independent risk factor for abIs (aOR 6.0, 95% CI \n1.34-26.81, p\u2009=\u20090.019). CaIs commonly involved empyema (84% [27/32] versus 53% \n[17/32] with abIs, p\u2009=\u20090.014). Individuals with CaIs tended to follow a \nrelatively indolent clinical course, were less likely to present with fever (aOR \n0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.68), and had favorable outcomes. When compared with CaIs, \npatients with abIs were less likely to achieve clinical cure at 90 days (aOR \n0.02, 95% CI 0.001-0.41).\nCONCLUSIONS: Although no modifiable risk factors were identified, CaIs \nfrequently caused empyema, were less likely to present with fever, and were \nassociated with a favorable prognosis.\n\n© 2025.

China, 200011.\n\nBACKGROUND: Capsular contracture (CC) is one of the most common complications in \naugmentation mammaplasty with breast implant, but its etiology remains \nuncertain. We aimed to apply the 2bRAD-M technique to characterize the \nmicrobiome differences between normal and contracture capsules.\nMETHODS: 10 normal capsules and 10 contractured capsules were used for 2bRAD-M \nsequencing and corresponding histological evaluation. By constructing a mouse \nsilicone implant infection model, histological staining was used to verify the \ninfluence of different microorganisms identified in sequencing results.\nRESULTS: Histologic evaluation of patient samples revealed a marked increase in \nthe thickness and stiffness of contracture capsules, along with increased \ninfiltration of macrophages and T cells. Through 2bRAD-M sequencing, we found \nthat the microbial composition of contracture capsules was significantly \ndifferent from that of normal capsules, with the most significant difference of \nrelative abundance value in Ralstonia pickettii. In vivo, Ralstonia pickettii \ncould significantly increase the thickness, collagen content, and hardness of \nthe capsules, which was more effective than the combined infection with \nStaphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium acnes. Immunofluorescence results \nshowed both bacterial infections caused increased infiltration of macrophages \nand T cells, and Ralstonia pickettii infection caused more infiltration of T \ncells.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to use 2bRAD-M technique to characterize \nmicrobiome differences of relative abundance value between normal and \ncontracture capsules. Ralstonia pickettii can recruit more macrophages and T \ncells to infiltrate. This study provides new etiological causes of capsular \ncontracture and new clinical insights for the prevention and treatment of \ncapsular contracture.\n\nCopyright © 2025 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\n\nDOI: 10.1097/PRS.0000000000012570\nPMID: 41351228\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing interests: The authors of this article \naffirm that they are not involved in any conflicts of interest."},

Human and bacterial \nhyaluronidases (HAases) degrade HA, leading to inflammation, skin aging, and \nmicrobial invasion. Bioactive compounds commonly used in skincare products may \nexert antioxidant, anti-aging, and antibacterial effects on skin through \ninhibitory effects on human and bacterial HAases, which remain unexplored. In \nthis study, we investigated the evolutionary relationships between human and \nbacterial HAases and the anti-HAase activities of 16 skincare bioactives. \nBioinformatics analyses showed limited sequence similarity but conserved \ncatalytic residues, particularly among Streptococcus and Cutibacterium acnes \nisoforms. A complementary mechanistic and functional analysis of these \nbioactives revealed that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), rosmarinic acid (RA), \nretinol (ROL), ascorbic acid (AA), and hydroquinone (HQ) demonstrated relatively \nstrong binding profiles to human and bacterial HAase, with favorable skin \npenetration and safety profiles. Molecular dynamics simulations further \nconfirmed the stable binding of EGCG to both human and bacterial HAases. The \nminimum inhibitory concentration of HQ, EGCG, and ROL against Streptococcus \nagalactiae ranged from 32 to 512\xa0μg/mL, while HQ, kojic acid (KA), and azelaic \nacid (AzA) against C. acnes ranged from 1024 to 2048\xa0μg/mL. Furthermore, enzyme \nassays revealed that ROL, EGCG, HQ, and AA inhibited S. agalactiae HAase \n(ranging from 84.68 to 99.37\xa0%). AA, EGCG, AzA, alpha-tocopherol (AT), and \nsalicylic acid (SA) showed anti-HAase activity against C. acnes (ranging from \n94.23 to 99.51\xa0%). These findings on the anti-HAase activities of these \ncompounds provide a foundation for cosmetic and therapeutic approaches.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Through shotgun metagenomics, this study utilizes non-invasive air \nsampling of face masks and aircraft cabin filters to investigate microbial \ndiversity in environments with frequent human interactions, including hospitals \nand airplanes. A comprehensive sampling and analysis workflow was developed, \nincorporating environmental and enrichment protocols to enhance microbial DNA \nrecovery and diversity profiling.\nRESULTS: Despite limitations in biomass, optimized extraction methods allowed \nfor the successful identification of 407 species, with dominant taxa including \nCutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Sphingomonas hankookensis, and \nMethylobacterium radiotolerans.

Prior \nstudies, based on amplicon sequencing, have demonstrated major differences in \nskin microbiotas between the two populations. However, compositional differences \nin microbiota between sensitized and non-sensitized (NS) individuals have not \nbeen characterized. Here, in a selected population of 112 allergen-sensitized \nand NS adolescents, we used shotgun metagenomics to characterize the \nprokaryotic, eukaryotic and viral species in the skin potentially involved in \nallergic sensitization via distinct environmental exposures. In the more urban \nFinnish Karelia, the microbiome species composition was associated with \nIgE-mediated allergen sensitization status, while in the more rural Russian \nKarelia, the composition was associated with exposure to furry pets. Finnish \nparticipants showing high IgE-mediated sensitization to common allergens \n(allergen-specific IgE >7.5\u2009kU/L) had less Cutibacterium acnes and Malassezia in \ntheir skin and displayed weaker interconnectedness of the microbial \nco-occurrence network compared with NS participants. Moreover, Malassezia \nrestricta strain-level differences were related to allergen sensitization in \nboth Finnish and Russian participants. In summary, we found distinct skin \nmicrobiomes between allergen-sensitized and NS participants and tracked the \nbacterial and fungal species associated with the degree of allergic \nsensitization in the more urbanized part of the Karelian region.

LEfSe was performed to \nidentify different abundance taxa, 21 discriminative features between CAMR and \nSTABLE, 39 discriminative features between IgAN and STABLE. The mean decrease \nGini index and random forest analysis indicated that Staphylococcus_epidermidis \nmight serve as indicator bacteria for CAMR, Kocuria_palustris might serve as \nindicator bacteria for IgAN. ROC analysis was performed to assess the \nperformance of some optimal marker models, and the average AUC value achieved \n89.6% between CAMR and STABLE, 67.4% between IgAN and STABLE.

We aimed \nat determining whether the gut microbiota of sunbirds harbors bacterial species \nthat enable the birds to cope with these toxic alkaloids. An in vivo experiment \nthat included 12 birds showed that inducing dysbiosis in sunbirds' guts by the \naddition of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, significantly reduced the birds' \nability to degrade anabasine (n = 3) compared to control birds (n = 3) with \nundisturbed microbiota.

In an in vitro experiment, we studied the ability of Lactococcus \nlactis, Enterobacter hormaechei, Chryseobacterium gleum, Kocuria palustris, and \nMethylorubrum populi that were isolated from sunbirds' excreta, to degrade \nanabasine and nicotine.

Our findings demonstrate the \nrole of gut bacteria in detoxifying toxic secondary metabolites found in the N. \nglauca nectar.

Open reading frame (ORF) and \nhomology search analyses indicated that pKPAL3 possesses four ORFs; however, \nthere were no replication protein coding genes predicted in the plasmid. \nInstead, there were two nucleotide sequence regions that showed significant \nidentities with untranslated regions of K. rhizophila DC2201 (NBRC 103217) \ngenomic sequences, and these sequences were essential for autonomous replication \nof pKPAL3 in Kocuria cells. Based on these findings, we constructed the novel \nEscherichia coli-Kocuria shuttle vectors pKITE301 (kanamycin resistant) and \npKITE303 (thiostrepton resistant) from pKPAL3. The copy numbers of the \nconstructed shuttle vectors were estimated to be 20 per cell, and they exhibited \nlow segregation stability in Kocuria transformant cells in the absence of \nantibiotics. Moreover, constructed vectors showed compatibility with the other \nK. rhizophila shuttle vector pKITE103. We successfully expressed multiple \nheterologous genes, including the styrene monooxygenase gene from Rhodococcus \nsp. ST-10 (rhsmo) and alcohol dehydrogenase gene from Leifsonia sp. S749 \n(lsadh), in K. rhizophila DC2201 using the pKITE301P and pKITE103P vectors under \nthe control of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) promotor. \nThe RhSMO-LSADH co-expressing K. rhizophila was used as a biocatalyst in an \norganic solvent-water biphasic reaction system to efficiently convert styrene \ninto (S)-styrene oxide with 99% ee in the presence of 2-propanol as a hydrogen \ndonor. The product concentration of the reaction in the organic solvent reached \n235 mM after 30 h under optimum conditions. Thus, we demonstrated that this \nnovel shuttle vector is useful for developing biocatalysts based on organic \nsolvent-tolerant Kocuria cells.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2017.02313\nPMCID: PMC5711781\nPMID: 29230202'},

The aim of \nthis study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the most commonly used tests \nfor diagnosing these PJIs.\nMETHODS: A consecutive series of 420 patients undergoing revision total hip or \nknee arthroplasty were studied. Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Cutibacterium \nspp., enterococci, Actinomyces spp., and fungi were classified as low-virulence \npathogens. Of the 207 PJIs defined by the European Bone and Joint Infection \nSociety (EBJIS) criteria, 60 were chronic infections caused by low-virulence \npathogens. A total of 213 cases were classified as aseptic, resulting in a total \nof 273 cases included in the analysis. The performance of established test \nmethods was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\nRESULTS: The calculated synovial fluid percentage of polymorphonuclear \nneutrophils (SF-%PMN) cut-off of > 67% demonstrated the best preoperative \nperformance with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), \nnegative predictive value (NPV), and area under the curve (AUC) of 97.1% (95% CI \n83.9 to 100), 97.2% (95% CI 91.9 to 100), 97.1% (95% CI 91.6 to 100), 97.2% (95% \nCI 91.9 to 100), and 0.972 (95% CI 0.933 to 1.000), followed by SF white blood \ncell count (SF-WBC) > 2,403 cells/µl with estimates of 85.4% (95% CI 71.1 to \n93.4), 100% (95% CI 94.6 to 100), 100% (100), 93.3% (95% CI 88.0 to 98.5), and \n0.927 (95% CI 0.872 to 0.982). While a %PMN cut-off of > 67% outperformed the \nestablished threshold of > 80% (p = 0.010), the calculated SF-WBC cut-off of > \n2,403 G/l did not perform significantly better than the established threshold of \n> 3,000 G/l (p = 0.266).

This study \ninvestigated the dynamic remodeling of the gut microbiota and metabolome in \nSebastes schlegelii following infection with the major aquaculture pathogen \nEdwardsiella piscicida. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted \nmetabolomics, we analyzed the microbial community composition and metabolic \nprofiles of intestinal samples at multiple time points post-infection. Our \nresults revealed significant temporal shifts in bacterial diversity and \nstructure. Notably, the abundances of genera such as Bacteroides, Bacillus, and \nLactobacillus increased, while Comamonas and Cutibacterium decreased. \nMetabolomic analysis identified 1063 metabolites, with lipids and lipid-like \nmolecules being the most abundant. Differential analysis revealed stage-specific \nmetabolic alterations: early infection was marked by the upregulation of \npro-inflammatory mediators such as lithocholic acid and palmitoylethanolamide, \nwhereas late infection featured elevated levels of anti-inflammatory \nmetabolites, including cholic acid and agmatine. KEGG pathway analysis indicated \nan initial enrichment in general metabolic processes, followed by a shift to \nsteroid biosynthesis later in the infection. These findings suggest a \ncoordinated "metabolic switch" mechanism that modulates inflammation and \npromotes recovery. This study provides novel insights into the \nmicrobiota-metabolite-immune network in S. schlegelii and highlights potential \nbiomarkers for monitoring fish health status in aquaculture.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

This study aimed to compare the outcomes of single-stage versus \ntwo-stage revision and to identify clinical or demographic factors associated \nwith treatment failure.\nMETHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at a single tertiary \nhospital including 29 patients treated for shoulder PJI between 2010 and 2023. \nPatients underwent either one-stage (n\u2009=\u200915) or two-stage (n\u2009=\u200914) revision \naccording to clinical and microbiological criteria, and the final choice of \nsurgical strategy (one-stage vs. two-stage revision) was made at the discretion \nof the attending surgeon. The primary outcome was treatment success, defined as \ninfection eradication without further surgery or suppressive antibiotics. \nSecondary outcomes were pain and functional results measured with the \nConstant-Murley Score (CMS), the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the Visual \nAnalog Scale (VAS). A standard statistical analysis was performed comparing \nbaseline data of both groups and finding factors related to the primary outcome.\nRESULTS: Baseline characteristics of both groups were comparable. Overall \ninfection control was achieved in 83% of patients, nonetheless, the one-stage \ngroup showed a higher success rate compared with the two-stage group (93% vs. \n71%), although this difference did not reach statistical significance \n(p\u2009=\u20090.169; OR:0.19(0.003,2.29)). Functional outcomes assessed by CMS and VAS \ndid not differ significantly between groups, whereas SST scores were \nsignificantly better following one-stage revision (p\u2009=\u20090.006). Increased BMI and \na higher number of previous surgeries tended to be associated with treatment \nfailure.\nCONCLUSION: Single-stage revision achieved comparable infection control and \nbetter functional outcomes than two-stage revision, supporting its role as a \nreliable surgical option for shoulder PJI in appropriately selected patients, \nalthough it could be influenced by bias selection.\n\n© 2025.

We aimed to apply the 2bRAD-M technique to characterize the \nmicrobiome differences between normal and contracture capsules.\nMETHODS: 10 normal capsules and 10 contractured capsules were used for 2bRAD-M \nsequencing and corresponding histological evaluation. By constructing a mouse \nsilicone implant infection model, histological staining was used to verify the \ninfluence of different microorganisms identified in sequencing results.\nRESULTS: Histologic evaluation of patient samples revealed a marked increase in \nthe thickness and stiffness of contracture capsules, along with increased \ninfiltration of macrophages and T cells. Through 2bRAD-M sequencing, we found \nthat the microbial composition of contracture capsules was significantly \ndifferent from that of normal capsules, with the most significant difference of \nrelative abundance value in Ralstonia pickettii. In vivo, Ralstonia pickettii \ncould significantly increase the thickness, collagen content, and hardness of \nthe capsules, which was more effective than the combined infection with \nStaphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium acnes. Immunofluorescence results \nshowed both bacterial infections caused increased infiltration of macrophages \nand T cells, and Ralstonia pickettii infection caused more infiltration of T \ncells.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to use 2bRAD-M technique to characterize \nmicrobiome differences of relative abundance value between normal and \ncontracture capsules.

However, recent reports have documented cases of infections \noccurring after PRP therapy. In this study, we aimed to examine potential \nmicrobial contamination risks associated with PRP therapy and evaluate rapid \nmicrobial detection methods suitable for clinical use.\nMETHODS: We assessed the risk of microbial contamination during blood \ncollection, PRP preparation, and sterility testing. To evaluate suitable \ndetection methods, we compared the microbial detection sensitivities of flow \ncytometry (FCM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for identifying microbial \ncontamination in PRP. For this purpose, PRP samples were inoculated with \nStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Cutibacterium acnes, Micrococcus \nspp., Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans.\nRESULTS: Following skin disinfection, microbial colonies were detected at the \nvenipuncture site in six out of ten patients. Environmental monitoring \nidentified airborne microbial colonies in two out of three anonymous PRP \npreparation facilities. Sterility tests revealed negative results for all 85 \nresidual PRP and 15 platelet-poor plasma (PPP) cases. FCM sensitivity for \nmicrobial detection in PRP was effective at a concentration of 102-103 colony \nforming units (cfu)/mL or higher. While C. albicans could not be detected \nseparately from non-specific PRP signals using FCM, it was detectable in PPP at \n≥102\xa0cfu/mL. PCR sensitivity for microbial detection was excellent when \nanalyzing pure microbial suspensions, however, it yielded a high rate of \nfalse-negative and false-positive results when PRP samples contained certain \nmicrobial strains.\nCONCLUSION: The risks of microbial contamination were identified during both \nvenipuncture and PRP production. To reduce these risks, it may be necessary to \nimprove disinfection protocols for venipuncture sites and blood collection \nmethods, implementing appropriate facility-specific measures. Although requiring \nfurther detection sensitivity improvements, FCM is a promising method for \ndetecting viable bacteria in PRP.

Conventional \nenvironmental monitoring relies on particle counts and culture-based \ncolony-forming unit measurements. These indicators fail to capture much of the \ndiversity and provenance of airborne microbes because many taxa are \nnonculturable or require growth conditions not supported by standard culture \nmedia. Therefore, comprehensive DNA-based microbiome analysis is critical for \nevaluating microbial risks that conventional methods may overlook; however, such \nstudies remain limited in cleanroom settings. This study aimed to \ncomprehensively visualize the structure of airborne microbial communities in \ncleanroom environments and clarify microbial risks that cannot be fully captured \nby particle counts or culture-based methods.\nMETHODS: We collected airborne bacterial DNA from cleanrooms with environmental \nGrades B, C, and D using a high-volume air sampler. The DNA was extracted and \nanalyzed via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing targeting the V3-V4 regions. \nBioinformatic analysis was performed using the QIIME2 pipeline, and microbial \ndiversity was assessed using alpha and beta diversity indices. Abundant taxa \nwere categorized based on their likely origin (environment- or skin-derived), \nand their distributions were examined in relation to facility management \npractices.\nRESULTS: Analysis revealed the consistent detection of skin-associated bacteria, \nsuch as Cutibacterium and Corynebacterium, and environmental bacteria, including \nBacillus and Paracoccus, across all cleanroom grades. Alpha- and \nbeta-diversities exhibited no significant differences among the grades. However, \ntemporary and irregular increases in skin-derived bacteria indicated \noperator-related non-persistent contamination. This interpretation was supported \nby skewness and kurtosis analyses, which indicated occasional but noticeable \nshifts in microbial abundance, particularly in high-grade cleanroom \nenvironments.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the limitations of conventional \nculture-based monitoring and underscores the value of DNA-based approaches for \ncharacterizing airborne microbial communities in cleanrooms. The detection of \ntemporary increases in skin-associated bacteria indicates that operator-related \ncontamination can occur even under stringent environmental conditions. These \nfindings support the development of integrated monitoring strategies that can \ncapture both the composition and temporal fluctuations of airborne microbiota to \nenhance microbial risk assessment.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.reth.2025.10.019\nPMCID: PMC12616117\nPMID: 41244152\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no known \ncompeting financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared \nto influence the work reported in this paper.'}],

This study \ninvestigated the dynamic remodeling of the gut microbiota and metabolome in \nSebastes schlegelii following infection with the major aquaculture pathogen \nEdwardsiella piscicida. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted \nmetabolomics, we analyzed the microbial community composition and metabolic \nprofiles of intestinal samples at multiple time points post-infection. Our \nresults revealed significant temporal shifts in bacterial diversity and \nstructure. Notably, the abundances of genera such as Bacteroides, Bacillus, and \nLactobacillus increased, while Comamonas and Cutibacterium decreased. \nMetabolomic analysis identified 1063 metabolites, with lipids and lipid-like \nmolecules being the most abundant. Differential analysis revealed stage-specific \nmetabolic alterations: early infection was marked by the upregulation of \npro-inflammatory mediators such as lithocholic acid and palmitoylethanolamide, \nwhereas late infection featured elevated levels of anti-inflammatory \nmetabolites, including cholic acid and agmatine. KEGG pathway analysis indicated \nan initial enrichment in general metabolic processes, followed by a shift to \nsteroid biosynthesis later in the infection. These findings suggest a \ncoordinated "metabolic switch" mechanism that modulates inflammation and \npromotes recovery. This study provides novel insights into the \nmicrobiota-metabolite-immune network in S. schlegelii and highlights potential \nbiomarkers for monitoring fish health status in aquaculture.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

We aimed to apply the 2bRAD-M technique to characterize the \nmicrobiome differences between normal and contracture capsules.\nMETHODS: 10 normal capsules and 10 contractured capsules were used for 2bRAD-M \nsequencing and corresponding histological evaluation. By constructing a mouse \nsilicone implant infection model, histological staining was used to verify the \ninfluence of different microorganisms identified in sequencing results.\nRESULTS: Histologic evaluation of patient samples revealed a marked increase in \nthe thickness and stiffness of contracture capsules, along with increased \ninfiltration of macrophages and T cells. Through 2bRAD-M sequencing, we found \nthat the microbial composition of contracture capsules was significantly \ndifferent from that of normal capsules, with the most significant difference of \nrelative abundance value in Ralstonia pickettii. In vivo, Ralstonia pickettii \ncould significantly increase the thickness, collagen content, and hardness of \nthe capsules, which was more effective than the combined infection with \nStaphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium acnes. Immunofluorescence results \nshowed both bacterial infections caused increased infiltration of macrophages \nand T cells, and Ralstonia pickettii infection caused more infiltration of T \ncells.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to use 2bRAD-M technique to characterize \nmicrobiome differences of relative abundance value between normal and \ncontracture capsules. Ralstonia pickettii can recruit more macrophages and T \ncells to infiltrate.

Human and bacterial \nhyaluronidases (HAases) degrade HA, leading to inflammation, skin aging, and \nmicrobial invasion. Bioactive compounds commonly used in skincare products may \nexert antioxidant, anti-aging, and antibacterial effects on skin through \ninhibitory effects on human and bacterial HAases, which remain unexplored. In \nthis study, we investigated the evolutionary relationships between human and \nbacterial HAases and the anti-HAase activities of 16 skincare bioactives. \nBioinformatics analyses showed limited sequence similarity but conserved \ncatalytic residues, particularly among Streptococcus and Cutibacterium acnes \nisoforms. A complementary mechanistic and functional analysis of these \nbioactives revealed that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), rosmarinic acid (RA), \nretinol (ROL), ascorbic acid (AA), and hydroquinone (HQ) demonstrated relatively \nstrong binding profiles to human and bacterial HAase, with favorable skin \npenetration and safety profiles. Molecular dynamics simulations further \nconfirmed the stable binding of EGCG to both human and bacterial HAases. The \nminimum inhibitory concentration of HQ, EGCG, and ROL against Streptococcus \nagalactiae ranged from 32 to 512\xa0μg/mL, while HQ, kojic acid (KA), and azelaic \nacid (AzA) against C. acnes ranged from 1024 to 2048\xa0μg/mL. Furthermore, enzyme \nassays revealed that ROL, EGCG, HQ, and AA inhibited S. agalactiae HAase \n(ranging from 84.68 to 99.37\xa0%). AA, EGCG, AzA, alpha-tocopherol (AT), and \nsalicylic acid (SA) showed anti-HAase activity against C. acnes (ranging from \n94.23 to 99.51\xa0%). These findings on the anti-HAase activities of these \ncompounds provide a foundation for cosmetic and therapeutic approaches.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of the nosocomial environment in \nits evolution remains poorly understood. To investigate the genomic changes \nunderlying S. epidermidis evolutionary history, we compared genomes of 1960s \nisolates, before its recognition as a human pathogen, to those from the 1990s, \nwhen it became prevalent in hospital-acquired infections. We found that S. \nepidermidis from the 1960s and 1990s shared similar population structures, with \nthe A/C cluster predominating in both periods. Recombination was frequent, \nparticularly in the A/C cluster, and occurred throughout the chromosome. \nAlterations in the mobile genetic elements of the 1990s isolates caused a \ndrastic genomic change, characterized by phage loss, and staphylococcal cassette \nchromosome elements and insertion sequences acquisition. The 1990s isolates \ngained multiple antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, which are associated \nwith biofilm formation and persistence. Genomic analysis of the orfX/rmlH \nvicinity revealed differences between the two groups of isolates. The 1960s \nisolates harbored a complex orfX/rmlH vicinity containing multiple SCC and \npseudoSCC, and genes with high homology to SCCmecIV, while the 1990s isolates \ncontained only SCCmec and ACME. Interestingly, one early isolate carried a \ndisrupted mecA, within a pseudoSCCmecIV, suggesting it may represent a precursor \nto the contemporary SCCmecIV. Our results showed that prolonged exposure to the \nhospital environment drove S. epidermidis genomic remodeling, including the \naccumulation of genes linked to antibiotic resistance, enhanced colonization, \nbiofilm formation, genome plasticity, and the loss of bacteriophages \n-contributing to its success as a persistent nosocomial pathogen.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

Our objective was to identify pathogens \ncausing BSI, its incidence, and associated risk factors.\nMETHODOLOGY: Retrospective positive blood culture data were analyzed from five \nhemodialysis centers (January 2019 until December 2023) across Saudi Arabia.\nRESULTS: There were 437 bacteremia episodes in 432 patients, with 405 central \nline and 367 peripheral samples. The BSI rate was 0.67 per 100 patient months. \n375 (85.8%) patients had a Central Venous Catheter (CVC), 27 (6.17%) had an \narteriovenous fistula (AVF), 5 (1.14%) had an arteriovenous graft (AVG), and 30 \n(6.9%) had dual access. The central line-associated bloodstream infection \n(CLABSI) rate was 1.41 per 100 patient months. Gram-positive organisms in the \ncentral line blood culture were 169 (44%), and Gram-negative were 200 (51.81%); \n16 (4%) cases were polymicrobial, and there was one case of fungi. In peripheral \nblood cultures, 158 (48.9%) were Gram-positive and 150 (46.4%) were \nGram-negative. The most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, and \nStaphylococcus epidermidis in Gram-positive organisms, and Enterobacter cloacae, \nKlebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Gram-negative organisms. \nThree cases of fungal infection occurred during the study period. Two-thirds of \npatients (68%) required hospital treatment, and in 54% of the cases, there was \nloss of vascular access. Mortality due to sepsis within 4 weeks occurred in five \npatients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The risk of BSI in hemodialysis patients is high. Gram-negative \npathogens contribute to half of the events. In Saudi Arabia, Gram-negative \npathogen incidence is significant, and measures are required to curtail it.\n\nCopyright (c) 2025 Qurat Ul Ain, Muhammad N Hashmi, Alaa AL Sayed, Hammad Raza, \nMuhammad A Khan, Ebtehaj Alahmari, Raghad Alajlan, Reham Eladrosi, Muhammad W \nSaeed, Abdallah Ibrahim, Fayez Hejaili.\n\nDOI: 10.3855/jidc.21208\nPMID: 41358768 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No Conflict of Interest is declared'},

In Indonesia, severe infective ulcers often require keratoplasty (KP) \nto preserve ocular integrity and improve outcomes.\nAIM: To determine demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics, \ncomplications, and KP outcomes in patients with moderate to severe infective \ncorneal ulcers.\nMETHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on patients with moderate to \nsevere infective corneal ulcers who underwent KP between January 1, 2018 and \nDecember 31, 2020, with a minimum follow-up period of 3 weeks at the Ocular \nInfection and Immunology clinic of a tertiary referral hospital in Jakarta. Data \nwere extracted from medical records.\nRESULTS: A total of 99 eyes from 99 patients with a mean age of 41.7 ± 16.2 \nyears were included. Eight-nine eyes of corneal cases were located at the \ncentral cornea with > 6 mm lesion size (forty-one eyes). The culture positivity \nrate was 33%, primarily composed of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Eyeball \nintegrity was maintained in all patients. Mean uncorrected visual acuity (VA) \nbefore KP was 2.50 and improved to 2.04 after 3 months of follow-up. Twenty \npatients with a cornea that was kept transparent achieved a VA of 0.40. \nComplications after KP appeared in 60 eyes, while secondary glaucoma was the \nmost common complication (28 eyes), followed by graft failure (24 eyes) and \ngraft rejection (14 eyes).\nCONCLUSION: Corneal ulcers are a common problem in Indonesia following eye \ntrauma. Therapeutic and tectonic KP can preserve the integrity of the eyeball in \nmoderate to severe cases, although complications are common.\n\n©The Author(s) 2025.

However, the role of the nosocomial environment in \nits evolution remains poorly understood. To investigate the genomic changes \nunderlying S. epidermidis evolutionary history, we compared genomes of 1960s \nisolates, before its recognition as a human pathogen, to those from the 1990s, \nwhen it became prevalent in hospital-acquired infections. We found that S. \nepidermidis from the 1960s and 1990s shared similar population structures, with \nthe A/C cluster predominating in both periods. Recombination was frequent, \nparticularly in the A/C cluster, and occurred throughout the chromosome. \nAlterations in the mobile genetic elements of the 1990s isolates caused a \ndrastic genomic change, characterized by phage loss, and staphylococcal cassette \nchromosome elements and insertion sequences acquisition. The 1990s isolates \ngained multiple antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, which are associated \nwith biofilm formation and persistence. Genomic analysis of the orfX/rmlH \nvicinity revealed differences between the two groups of isolates. The 1960s \nisolates harbored a complex orfX/rmlH vicinity containing multiple SCC and \npseudoSCC, and genes with high homology to SCCmecIV, while the 1990s isolates \ncontained only SCCmec and ACME. Interestingly, one early isolate carried a \ndisrupted mecA, within a pseudoSCCmecIV, suggesting it may represent a precursor \nto the contemporary SCCmecIV. Our results showed that prolonged exposure to the \nhospital environment drove S. epidermidis genomic remodeling, including the \naccumulation of genes linked to antibiotic resistance, enhanced colonization, \nbiofilm formation, genome plasticity, and the loss of bacteriophages \n-contributing to its success as a persistent nosocomial pathogen.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

Bile from a cow, known as gall, together with garlic, wine, \nand leeks, is used in the traditional medicine recipe of Bald's Leechbook, a \nthousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon formula for the treatment of infected eyelash \nfollicles. Different aspects of previous works on bile acids have been reported, \nand this work adds antiviral, virucidal, and antibacterial properties of bile \nacids and their salts against SARS-CoV-2. Four bile acids, lithocholic acid \n(LCA, 1), deoxycholic acid (DCA, 5), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, 9), and \nchenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, 13), were used to form salts with l-carnitine [X], \ncreatinine [Y], and choline [Z], which are naturally occurring compounds. Bile \nacids and their salts were evaluated for antiviral and virucidal activities \nagainst SARS-CoV-2 as well as for their antibacterial properties. Among the bile \nacids tested, LCA (1) was found to display virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2 \nwith an EC50 of 9.69 µg mL-1 and a selectivity index (SI) of >5.16. However, its \nsalts, [LCA][X] (2), [LCA][Y] (3), and [LCA][Z] (4), were 1.31-3.27 times less \nactive than the bile acid LCA (1), indicating that salt forms of this bile acid \ndid not have improved virucidal activity. Bile acids DCA (5), UDCA (9), and CDCA \n(13) exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus \ncereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus \nfaecalis) and against a Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli). Cholinium \nsalts of these bile acids exhibited enhanced antibacterial activity; for \nexample, 41.4-41.5% antibacterial improvement was observed for the [DCA][Z] (8) \nsalt when compared with its corresponding bile acid DCA (5). This work provides \nevidence that certain salts of bile acids have improved antibacterial activity, \nbut they do not enhance antiviral properties.\n\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nDOI: 10.1039/d5ra07917a\nPMCID: PMC12679602\nPMID: 41357123\n\nConflict of interest statement: There are no conflicts to declare."},

Herein, \nStaphylococcus epidermidis GXALA1 was isolated from highly Al-polluted soil in \nChina and showed excellent Al3+ adsorption capacity. The microscopic analyses \nand adsorption experiments showed that 80\u202f% of Al3+ was adsorbed onto the \nsurface of S. epidermidis GXALA1 through EPS, forming granular deposits. The EPS \nsecreted from S. epidermidis GXALA1 also displayed a strong adsorptive capacity, \nwith a high adsorption rate of 93.88\u202f%. The Freundlich isotherm model provided a \nbetter fit for the Al3+ experimental data with a higher R2 of 0.957, and the \npseudo-second-order model fitted the sorption kinetic processes with an \nadsorption capacity of 87.19\u202fmg/g.

SE population is composed of \ntwo clonal lineages, A/C and B, with distinct pathogenic potential. Although pH \nis known to change during infection when SE crosses the host skin to access the \nbloodstream, the impact of this pH alteration on SE pathogenicity is poorly \nunderstood. Recognizing how SE deals with pH increments will help designing \neffective prevention and treatment strategies against SE infections. To \ninvestigate the metabolic adaptations of representative A/C and B strains to pH, \nwe mimicked skin and blood pH conditions (5.5 and 7.4) and followed biomass \nformation, growth media pH and exometabolites over time. Although both strains \nshare some metabolic patterns, specificities were identified for each strain and \npH condition. The B strain was better adapted to use diverse carbon sources and \nat blood pH has a more active TCA cycle and amino acid catabolism. At blood pH, \nthe B strain depletes formate from the extracellular media, while its \nextracellular accumulation by the A/C strain could work as a host invasion \nstrategy. For both SE strains, TCA cycle regulation, purine biosynthesis and \nglutamate uptake could be associated with virulence, particularly biofilm \nproduction, especially relevant for ICE25 which is able to produce high \nadherence biofilm. The uptake and consumption of saccharides follow similar \nprofiles and seem to be pH-regulated by both strains. The dynamic study of SE \nexometabolome has contributed to understanding the intracellular processes and \ntheir relationship with virulence.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

This study aims to systematically review \nthe microbiological spectrum of SI to enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform \neffective antibiotic treatment strategies. The last search was conducted on May \n9th, 2024, from databases including EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The \noutcome variable is infection rate, and the detection method used should be \nblood culture, tissue culture, or molecular biology method. Two researchers \nindependently extracted research data and evaluated its quality using the JBI \nCritical Appraisal Tools. Out of 14,639 identified records, 156 studies \n(encompassing 13,539 patients) were included. Staphylococcus aureus was \nidentified as the most prevalent pathogen, with pooled infection rates of 17.6% \n(95%CI: 12.8-22.9%; I2=93%) in blood culture, 16.8% (95%CI: 14.0-19.8%; I2=96%) \nin tissue culture, and 12.0% (95%CI: 9.3-15.0%; I2=35%) in molecular methods. \nThe bacterial spectrum also featured Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia \ncoli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Molecular methods, particularly \nmetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), demonstrated markedly superior \nsensitivity for MTB detection, with a pooled rate of 9.7% (95%CI: 4.6-16.3%; \nI2=90%) compared to 1.3% (95%CI: 0.6-2.1%; I2=86%) by tissue culture. The odds \nratio for MTB detection with mNGS versus conventional culture was 4.24 (95%CI: \n1.68-10.73). This review confirms that a core group of pathogens, including \nStaphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, MTB, and Escherichia coli. \nOur findings underscore that tissue culture is fundamental for common pyogenic \nbacteria, while metagenomic next-generation sequencing is indispensable for \ndetecting fastidious organisms like MTB.

Data from Eastern Europe and \nthe Caucasus are scarce, limiting region-specific infection control strategies.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter surveillance study across five \ntertiary hospitals in Georgia from May 2020 to December 2023. A total of 484 \nrespiratory specimens were obtained from 397 adult patients with \nmicrobiologically confirmed NP. Pathogen identification was performed using \nculture and MALDI-TOF MS, with antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to \nCLSI guidelines. PCR assays detected major resistance genes. Epidemiological, \nmolecular, and clinical outcomes were evaluated, including temporal trends and \ncomparisons between ICU and non-ICU patients.\nRESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria predominated (71.7%), with Pseudomonas \naeruginosa (41.9%) as the leading pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus \n(21.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (13.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), and \nStreptococcus pneumoniae (9.3%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was identified in \n80% of isolates, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) phenotypes in 18.4%, and \npandrug-resistant (PDR) phenotypes in 1.4%. ESBL prevalence increased from 48.3% \nin 2020 to 79.8% in 2023 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), carbapenemase expression doubled from \n15.0% to 30.2% (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and colistin resistance rose from 2.5% to 8.5% \n(p\u2009<\u20090.05). ICU isolates showed significantly higher MDR and XDR rates than \nthose from non-ICU settings (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Thirty-day mortality correlated with \nresistance phenotype, ranging from 18.2% in susceptible infections to 71.4% in \nPDR cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: This four-year study shows high and increasing antimicrobial \nresistance among NP pathogens in Georgia, especially in ICU settings. The rise \nin ESBL, carbapenemase, and colistin resistance highlights the need to \nstrengthen antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention, and genomic \nsurveillance to control the spread of high-risk strains and improve patient \noutcomes in resource-limited settings.\n\n© 2025.

The combination of CEE and Silymarin® exhibited potent \nantibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, \nPseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli with MIC values ranging from 182.32 \nto 201.63\xa0μg/mL. The combination of CEE and Silymarin® significantly reduced \nnitric oxide levels and increased superoxide dismutase activity in \nlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inflamed HepG-2 cells more than CEE and Silymarin® \nalone, thereby this combination acting as a potent anti-inflammatory and \nantioxidant candidate. The results indicated that the combination of CEE and \nSilymarin® was successfully reduced CCl4-induced liver fibrosis as approved by a \nlarge increase in serum CD4 and albumin levels and the activity of hepatic \nantioxidant enzymes.

In polymicrobial environments, it forms dual-species biofilms in \nwhich microbial interactions influence structure, virulence, and antibiotic \nresponse. Sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations may modulate these behaviors \ndifferently in single- versus dual-species settings. This study evaluated the \neffect of Tobramycin at ½ minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) on biofilm \nformation and virulence gene expression (toxA, lipA) in P. aeruginosa under \nsingle- and dual-species biofilm conditions. Clinical isolates were tested for \nTobramycin susceptibility, MIC determination, and biofilm production. Biofilm \nbiomass was quantified by microtiter assays, and gene expression was assessed by \nqRT-PCR. Overall, 78% of isolates were resistant to Tobramycin, with most MICs \nat 32\xa0µg/ml (37.3%) and 1024\xa0µg/ml (11.8%). All isolates formed biofilms, \npredominantly at moderate levels (63.08%). Tobramycin at ½ MIC significantly \nreduced biofilm biomass in both single-species (median OD₆₃₀: 0.128\u2009±\u20090.08 to \n0.077\u2009±\u20090.09; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and dual-species biofilms (0.158\u2009±\u20090.037 to \n0.106\u2009±\u20090.041; p\u2009=\u20090.0005). toxA expression decreased markedly in dual-species \nbiofilms compared to single-species (0.003\u2009±\u20090.0002 vs. 0.05\u2009±\u20090.009; \np\u2009=\u20090.0003), while lipA expression showed a nonsignificant decline. In \nconclusion, sub-MIC Tobramycin reduces P. aeruginosa biofilm biomass and \ndownregulates virulence genes, with more pronounced effects in dual-species \nbiofilms. These findings highlight the potential impact of low-level antibiotic \nexposure on biofilm-associated pathogenicity and may inform optimized dosing \nstrategies for chronic polymicrobial infections.\n\n© 2025.

One of the \nprimary pathological features of sepsis is immunosuppression, which is largely \nmediated by endotoxin tolerance. Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), a gut probiotic, \nis known to modulate host immune responses. There is a pressing need to explore \nits potential role in addressing sepsis-induced immunosuppression.\nMETHODS: To assess the abundance of AKK in immunosuppressed and normal immune \ngroups, 16S rRNA sequencing was conducted. This analysis helped to explore the \ncorrelation between immunosuppression and decreased AKK levels. Flow cytometry \nand ELISA were used to probe the effects of AKK on the phenotype of \nendotoxin-tolerant macrophages and to test its ability to clear Pseudomonas \naeruginosa. An endotoxin-tolerant mouse model was employed to validate the role \nof AKK in alleviating sepsis-induced immunosuppression through its effects on \nmacrophage phenotypes.\nRESULTS: In in vitro experiments, an endotoxin-tolerant macrophage model \nconstructed using RAW 264.7 cells showed that endotoxin-tolerant macrophages \ntended to be of the M2 phenotype, as evidenced by a decrease in M1-type \nmacrophages and an increase in M2-type macrophages. Further in vitro experiments \nshowed that the addition of AKK preparations was able to reduce M2-type \nmacrophages and increase M1-type macrophages, suggesting that AKK bacteria were \nable to induce a shift in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages from the M2 to the M1 \nphenotype. In animal experiments, the endotoxin tolerance model in mice treated \nwith different AKK preparations further confirmed that AKK bacteria alleviated \nthe immunosuppressive state of septic mice by modulating the phenotype of \nendotoxin-tolerant macrophages.\nCONCLUSION: Our research underscores the crucial role of AKK in mitigating \nsepsis-induced immunosuppression by steering the phenotype of endotoxin-tolerant \nmacrophages. This insight positions AKK as a promising candidate for therapeutic \nintervention, potentially leading to advancements in the management of sepsis.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

Over a \n14-month period, we studied the frequency of ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance \ndevelopment and mechanisms underlying resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates after \nceftolozane/tazobactam treatment as well as alternative therapeutic options.\nMETHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed with the disc diffusion \nmethod and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Resistance \ngenes and sequence types (ST) were determined by whole genome sequencing (WGS). \nThe ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance mechanism was explored by cloning ampC \ninto the ampC-deficient strain PAO1 and blaAmpC expression experiments.\nRESULTS: Of 50 patients treated, 9 (18%) acquired one or more \nceftolozane/tazobactam-resistant isolates during treatment. WGS revealed various \nmutations in the ampC gene, namely, Thr70Ile, Phe121Leu, Pro154Leu, Gly157Asp, \ndel210-216, Glu221Lys, and the new mutation, Pro217Gln. Cloning experiments \nrevealed that the Pseudomonas-derived cephalosporinase (PDC) polymorphism did \nnot alter mutation effects, mutations did not confer the same resistance level, \nand those conferring the strongest resistance restored susceptibility to \npiperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem despite changes in the oprD \ngene. In clinical isolates, the resistance level conferred by the same mutations \ndiffered, indicating the involvement of other mechanisms, particularly the \noverproduction of AmpC, which is always present due to mutations mainly in AmpD. \nFinally, imipenem/relebactam, colistin, amikacin and cefiderocol could be good \nalternatives for treating ceftolozane/tazobactam-resistant strains.\nCONCLUTION: Ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance development was associated mainly \nwith chromosomal mutations in the ampC gene but also with mutations in its \nregulatory genes. Knowledge about these mutations and gene polymorphisms is \nessential for interpreting resistance phenotypes from genomic data.\n\n© 2025.

Ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) is a \ncritical last-resort agent against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens; \nhowever, resistance is emerging, particularly mediated by blaKPC variants. In \nthis study, we investigated the prevalence and mechanisms of CZA resistance \namong CRPA isolates collected from two tertiary hospitals in Hangzhou between \n2021 and 2022. A total of 273 non-duplicate CRPA isolates were screened, among \nwhich 13.9% (38/273) exhibited CZA resistance (MIC ≥ 16 µg/mL). Whole-genome \nsequencing revealed that resistant strains were highly resistant to carbapenems, \ncephalosporins, and aztreonam but retained partial susceptibility to \naminoglycosides and polymyxins. ST463 was the predominant sequence type (76.3%), \nstrongly associated with blaKPC-2 carriage and virulence genes, such as exoU and \npldA. Notably, three blaKPC variants-KPC-14, KPC-33, and KPC-86-were identified, \nall conferring high-level resistance to CZA (MIC > 32 µg/mL). KPC-86 was \ndiscovered for the first time in P. aeruginosa, embedded in an IS26-flanked \ntransposon, suggesting potential for horizontal transfer. Sequential recovery of \nKPC-86 and KPC-33 from the same patient supports in vivo evolution under \nantibiotic pressure. These findings highlight the evolving threat of CZA \nresistance in CRPA, driven by blaKPC diversification within high-risk clones. \nContinued genomic surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship are urgently needed \nto preserve the efficacy of CZA.IMPORTANCECeftazidime-avibactam (CZA) is one of \nthe few remaining options to treat serious infections caused by drug-resistant \nPseudomonas aeruginosa. However, its effectiveness is now being threatened by \nemerging genetic changes that reduce susceptibility. In this study, we \ninvestigated CZA-resistant strains and uncovered three variants of the \nresistance gene blaKPC, including one-KPC-86-never before seen in P. aeruginosa. \nThis variant was located on a mobile genetic element, raising concerns about its \npotential to spread between bacteria. We also documented the evolution of \nresistance within a single patient, showing how treatment pressure can drive \ngenetic change. By combining clinical, microbiological, and genomic data, our \nfindings highlight an urgent need for ongoing surveillance and careful \nantibiotic use to preserve the usefulness of last-resort drugs like CZA. This \nwork informs both clinicians and public health experts on emerging resistance \nthreats.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/spectrum.02187-25\nPMID: 41358988'},

This study \ncharacterizes KP27 endolysin, a 131-amino acid enzyme encoded by the Klebsiella \nphage KP27, which exhibits L-alanyl-D-glutamate endopeptidase activity that is \neffective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Recombinant \nKP27 was expressed and purified with a molecular weight of approximately 15\xa0kDa. \nIt demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity, reducing Staphylococcus \naureus and Escherichia coli viability by up to 80% and 65%, respectively, at \n8\xa0µg/mL. Time-kill assays revealed rapid bacterial lysis within 60\xa0min at 2× MIC \n(16\xa0µg/mL for S. aureus and 32\xa0µg/mL for E. coli with EDTA). Thermal assays \nindicated substantial stability up to 50\xa0°C. Hemolytic tests revealed minimal \ncytotoxicity, with less than 5% hemolysis at concentrations as high as \n100\xa0µg/mL. AlphaFold2 modeling and molecular docking identified key \nsubstrate-binding residues consistent with L-alanyl-D-glutamate cleavage \nspecificity. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a predominantly \nalpha-helical secondary structure (~\u200955%) at pH 8.0, which was correlated with \nmaximal enzymatic activity; this helicity decreased to ~\u200944-49% at pH 6.0 and \n10.0, which coincided with reduced activity. Intrinsic fluorescence indicated a \nwell-folded tertiary structure under optimal conditions, whereas ANS \nfluorescence confirmed minimal exposure of hydrophobic residues at pH 8.0. They \nrevealed that KP27 maintains a predominantly alpha-helical secondary structure \nand a tightly folded tertiary conformation at an optimal pH of 8.0, which is \nstrongly correlated with maximal enzymatic activity. Together, these data \nhighlight KP27 endolysin as a stable, broad-spectrum antimicrobial enzyme with \npromising therapeutic potential against resistant bacterial pathogens.\n\n© 2025.

Tissue samples were \nobtained through biopsy, punch, or fluid aspiration. All MRSA isolates underwent \ngenomic sequencing. Factors associated with poor outcomes were analyzed using \nmultivariate regression analysis, complemented by penalized regression (LASSO) \nwith stratified cross-validation and sensitivity analyses to mitigate the risk \nof overestimation given the limited MRSA sample size.\nRESULTS: A total of 118 patients were studied, 60.2% male, with a mean age of \n41.1 years (±\xa0SD 26.1). Recurrence and death occurred in 13.5% and 7.6% of \ncases, respectively. Diagnostic yielded 145 microorganisms, 61.4% were S. \naureus, 24.1% being MRSA and 25.5% multidrug-resistant. Thirty-five MRSA strains \nbelonged to clonal complexes 5, 8, and 30, with a predominance of the \nST105-MRSA-II-t2 clone. Deep tissue involvement was associated with an increased \nlikelihood of severe outcomes, with an odds ratio of 13.2 (p\xa0=\xa00.036), whereas \npenalized regression confirmed deep infection as the most stable predictor.

At present, \nneutrophils in chronic bone infections exhibit significant heterogeneity but \nfunctional alterations that remain poorly understood.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat model of chronic bone infection induced by \nMethicillin- Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) was established. Bone marrow \ncells were analyzed using scRNA-seq with Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway \nenrichment analysis. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified to \nassess neutrophil dysfunction, validated by immunofluorescence staining and ROS \nquantification.\nRESULTS: MRSA-induced chronic bone infection was confirmed by Gram and H&E \nstaining, which showed bacterial colonization and inflammation. Neutrophils from \ninfected rats showed downregulated immune-related genes (e.g., Clec7a, Ccr5) and \nupregulated immunosuppressive factors (e.g., Nfkbia, IL10ra). Enrichment \nanalysis showed that immune responses and neutrophil functions were inhibited. \nImmunofluorescence showed neutrophil polarization towards N2 phenotype and \nreduced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production in the infection group.\nDISCUSSION: This study established a rat model of MRSA-induced chronic bone \ninfection and identified 7 neutrophil subsets via scRNA-seq analysis, with the \nNeuP2ry10 subset showing the most significant changes. Neutrophils displayed \ndecreased chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and ROS production, along with elevated \nanti-inflammatory gene expression, suggesting functional suppression and a shift \ntoward an immunosuppressive state.\nCONCLUSION: Chronic bone infection drives neutrophil polarization toward an N2 \nanti-inflammatory phenotype, reducing antimicrobial capacity and promoting \ninfection persistence. Targeting neutrophil function may offer new therapeutic \nstrategies for chronic bone infection.\n\nCopyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at \nepub@benthamscience.net.\n\nDOI: 10.2174/0109298673432965251027081909\nPMID: 41355542'},

Here, we \ndemonstrate that BotA2 inhibits bacterial translation with unique context \nspecificity determined by the mRNA coding sequence. Using high-throughput \ntoe-printing coupled with deep sequencing (Toe-seq analysis), we show that BotA2 \ninduces ribosome pausing predominantly when a glycine codon enters the A-site of \nthe ribosome, regardless of the codon identities in the P- and E-sites. Our \nbiochemical and biophysical data indicate that BotA2 specifically arrests \nglycine-delivering ternary complexes on the ribosome, thereby preventing full \naccommodation of incoming Gly-tRNAGly within the peptidyl transferase center. \nAltogether, our findings uncover a previously undescribed mechanism of \ntranslation inhibition, driven by the context-specific immobilization of ternary \ncomplexes on elongating ribosomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1134/S0006297925603740\nPMID: 41354073 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'}]},

The inhaled foreign body may act as carrier \nof infectious material and the aim of this study was to explore the bacterial \nspecies associated with aspirated foreign bodies in a cohort of children.\nMETHODS: Retrospective case series of 34 patients who underwent rigid \nlaryngobronchoscopy because of foreign body aspiration. Each patient had a \nsample taken from tracheobronchial secretions during the procedure.\nRESULTS: The average patient age was 31.2 months and the average hospital stay \nwas 2.5 days. Of the foreign bodies 24 (71%) were organic in nature and 10 (29%) \nwere non-organic. Twenty eight (82.3%) patients had mixed oropharyngeal flora \norganisms growth. Fifteen (44%) samples were positive for organisms other than \noropharyngeal flora with the most common cultured organisms being: Streptococcus \npneumonia (4/12%), Haemophilus influenza (4/12%), Moraxella catarrhalis (4/12%). \nFour samples (12%) grew a fungus; Candida albicans was cultured in 3 patients \nand Aspergillus glaucus was identified in one sample. Of the non-oropharyngeal \norganisms 7(47%) demonstrated antibiotic resistance with four having resistance \nto amoxycillin, two resistant to penicillin and one resistant to cotrimoxazole.\nCONCLUSION: Some children who present with aspirated foreign body may be \ncomplicated with secondary airway infection. Antibacterial treatment might be \nconsidered in some of these cases. The regimen of antibiotics should aim to \ncover oropharyngeal flora, S. pneumonia, H. influenza and Moraxella catarrhalis.\n\nCopyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

An efficient \nstraw-composting system relies on thermophilic fungi and their lignocellulose \nhydrolases. Thermomyces lanuginosus, a typical thermophilic fungus in compost, \nlacks cellulase genes. A versatile Thermomyces strain capable of degrading \ncellulose, T. lanuginosus M85, which grows at 67\xa0°C, was developed and \ntransformed using the AgCMCase of Aspergillus glaucus. The R6 transformant \nexhibited high-level expression of the AgCMCase. Significant quantities of \nactive cellulase produced by R6 were detected in the cellulose fermentation \nbroth, peaking within 6-8\xa0days. Compost analysis indicated that R6 increased the \ninternal compost temperatures and prolonged high-temperature durations. \nCorrespondingly, more reducing sugars and humus were released, which could \npromote plants growth. In summary, a cellulase-producing strain of T. \nlanuginosus capable of efficiently converting straws into organic fertilizers \nwas engineered. This innovation holds considerable promise for sustainable and \ncircular agricultural practices.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

Fungi have a \nremarkable ability to exclude heavy metals from wastewater through biosorption \nin eco-friendly way. Tannase plays an important role in bioconversion of tannin, \na major constituent of tannery effluent, to gallic acid which has great \npharmaceutical applications. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to \nexploit the potential of tannase from Aspergillus glaucus and fungal biomass \nwaste for the bioremediation of heavy metals and tannin.\nRESULTS: Tannase from A. glaucus was partially purified 4.8-fold by ammonium \nsulfate precipitation (80%). The enzyme was optimally active at pH 5.0 and 40\xa0°C \nand stable at this temperature for 1\xa0h. Tannase showed high stability at \ndifferent physiological conditions, displayed about 50% of its activity at 60\xa0°C \nand pH range 5.0-6.0. Immobilization of tannase was carried out using methods \nsuch. as entrapment in Na-alginate and covalent binding to chitosan. The effects \nof Na-alginate concentrations on the beads formation and enzyme immobilization \nrevealed that maximum immobilization efficiency (75%) was obtained with 3% \nNa-alginate. A potential reusability of the immobilized enzyme was showed \nthrough keeping 70% of its relative activity up to the fourth cycle. The best \nbioconversion efficiency of tannic acid to gallic acid by immobilized tannase \nwas at 40\xa0°C with tannic acid concentration up to 50\xa0g/l. Moreover, \nbioremediation of heavy metal (Cr3+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, and Mn2+) from aqueous \nsolution using A. glaucus biomass waste was achieved with uptake percentage of \n(37.20, 60.30, 55.27, 79.03 and 21.13 respectively). The biomass was \nsuccessfully used repeatedly for removing Cr3+ after using desorbing agent \n(0.1\xa0N HCl) for three cycles.\nCONCLUSION: These results shed the light on the potential use of tannase from \nlocally isolated A. glaucus in the bioremediation of industrial tanneries \ncontained heavy metals and tannin.\n\n© 2024.

In this study, 15 fungal \nisolates were obtained from Egyptian cultivated soil and marine samples. The \nisolated fungi were qualitatively and quantitatively screened for their \nabilities to produce tannase. The selected fungal isolate NRC8 giving highest \ntannase activity was identified by molecular technique (18S rRNA) as Aspergillus \nglaucus. Among different tannin-containing wastes tested, the black tea waste \nwas the best substrate for tannase production by Aspergillus glaucus in \nsolid-state fermentation (SSF). Optimization of the different process parameters \nrequired for maximum enzyme production was carried out to design a suitable SSF \nprocess. Maximal tannase production was achieved with moisture content of 75%, \nan inoculums size of 6\u2009×\u2009108 spore/ml and sodium nitrate 0.2% (pH of 5.0) at \n30\xa0°C after 5\xa0days of incubation. Box-Behnken experiment was designed to get a \nquadratic model for further optimization studies. Four-factor response-surface \nmethod with 27 runs was prepared using independent parameters including \n(moisture content %, initial pH, substrate concentration (g) and sodium nitrate \nconcentration (g) for tannase model. The F- and P-values of the model were 4.30 \nand 0.002, respectively, which implied that the model is significant. In \naddition, the lack-of-fit was 1040.37 which indicates the same significance \nrelative to the pure error. A. glaucus tannase was evaluated by the efficiency \nof conversion of tannic acid to gallic acid. Moreover, production of gallic acid \nfrom SSF process of A. glaucus using black tea waste was found to be \n38.27\xa0mg/ml. The best bioconversion efficiency was achieved at 40\xa0°C with tannic \nacid concentration up to 200\xa0g/L.\n\n© 2023.

Previous studies shed light on the important \nrole that Aspergillus nidulans gfdB, putatively encoding a NAD+-dependent \nglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, plays in the oxidative and cell wall \nintegrity stress tolerance of this filamentous fungus model organism. The \ninsertion of A. nidulans gfdB into the genome of Aspergillus glaucus \nstrengthened the environmental stress tolerance of this xerophilic/osmophilic \nfungus, which may facilitate the involvement of this fungus in various \nindustrial and environmental biotechnological processes. On the other hand, the \ntransfer of A. nidulans gfdB to Aspergillus wentii, another promising industrial \nxerophilic/osmophilic fungus, resulted only in minor and sporadic improvement in \nenvironmental stress tolerance and meanwhile partially reversed osmophily. \nBecause A. glaucus and A. wentii are phylogenetically closely related species \nand both fungi lack a gfdB ortholog, these results warn us that any disturbance \nof the stress response system of the aspergilli may elicit rather complex and \neven unforeseeable, species-specific physiological changes. This should be taken \ninto consideration in any future targeted industrial strain development projects \naiming at the fortification of the general stress tolerance of these fungi. KEY \nPOINTS: • A. wentii c' gfdB strains showed minor and sporadic stress tolerance \nphenotypes. • The osmophily of A. wentii significantly decreased in the c' gfdB \nstrains. • Insertion of gfdB caused species-specific phenotypes in A. wentii and \nA. glaucus.\n\n© 2023.

Voriconazole (VOR) is effective against FK, but its eye \ndrop formulations suffer from poor bioavailability, while intrastromal \ninjections are invasive and carry risks. This study aimed to address these \nchallenges by formulating a VOR nanosuspension (NS) and fabricating an ocular \nbilayer dissolving microneedle array patch (dMAP) incorporating the VOR NS for \nlocalized drug delivery to the cornea. The VOR NS was prepared using an aqueous \nmedia milling method with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) \nas stabilizer and cryoprotectant, resulting in stable nanosized particles with a \nmean size of 270.11\u2009±\u20095.82\xa0nm and a PDI of 0.217\u2009±\u20090.019. The formulation \ndemonstrated a 1.71-fold increase in saturation solubility and a high drug \ncontent (72.5%). Both VOR NS and free VOR were incorporated into the MAP tips \nusing a two-layer casting method. The VOR NS-loaded bilayer dMAP exhibited \nhigher drug content (118.84\u2009±\u200920.67\xa0µg) compared to the free VOR-loaded bilayer \ndMAP (83.08\u2009±\u20092.69\xa0µg). Additionally, they demonstrated superior mechanical \nstrength, greater insertion depth (~\u2009390\xa0μm), and faster tip dissolution in \nexcised porcine corneal tissue (~\u20095\xa0min) compared to the free VOR-loaded bilayer \ndMAP. Ex vivo studies showed that the VOR NS-loaded bilayer dMAP deposited \n47.38\u2009±\u20098.08\xa0µg of drug into the porcine cornea, 2.31 times more than the free \nVOR-loaded bilayer dMAP (20.43\u2009±\u20096.11\xa0µg), closely approximating the clinical \ndose used in VOR intrastromal injections (50\xa0µg/0.1 mL). Furthermore, the disc \ndiffusion assay revealed that VOR NS and VOR NS-loaded bilayer dMAP had greater \nantifungal activity against Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus compared \nto free VOR and free VOR-loaded bilayer dMAP. Biocompatibility was confirmed \nthrough a human corneal epithelial cell viability assay, and ocular irritation \npotential was evaluated using the HET-CAM assay, revealing a safe and \nnon-irritant profile. Thus, this innovative NS-MAP hybrid system offers \nefficient drug delivery with minimal invasiveness and could potentially improve \ntherapeutic outcomes in the management of FK.\n\n© 2025.

Here, we aim to \nunveil the mechanism of BER against the pathogenicity of A. fumigatus through \nmitochondrial dynamics and related pathways. In vitro assays revealed that \nberberine treatment triggered mitochondrial fragmentation, resulting in reactive \noxygen species (ROS) overaccumulation. Subsequent proteomic analyses identified \nHog1-MAPK as the central signaling hub activated by ROS stress. Upon activation, \nHog1 localizes to the nucleus. ROS scavenging (N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment) \nabolished BER's antifungal effects, confirming the ROS-Hog1-cell cycle axis. \nCrucially, in a murine invasive aspergillosis model, BER reduced the fungal \nburden in lungs and improved survival rates. Thus, we demonstrate that berberine \nsuppresses A. fumigatus growth by disrupting mitochondrial dynamics, elevating \nreactive ROS, and activating the Hog1-MAPK signaling cascade, ultimately \ninducing cell cycle arrest. Our findings unveil a previously unrecognized \nmechanism linking mitochondrial morphology dysregulation to cell cycle control \nin fungi and establish BER as a promising therapeutic agent targeting \nmitochondrial-ROS-Hog1 signaling in A. fumigatus infections.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acsinfecdis.5c00749\nPMID: 41358602"}],

Thirty pectinolytic isolates \nobtained from decayed fruits in Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, yielded three Bacillus \namyloliquefaciens strains (SPR6, ST9, SC2) with superior enzyme productivity. \nUnder optimized submerged fermentation (pH 9.0, 37\xa0°C, 48\xa0h), strain ST9 \nachieved 22.4 U/mL, a 1.78-fold increase over baseline, while replacing \ncommercial pectin with orange peel enhanced yield by 1.32-fold and reduced \nsubstrate costs by 99%. The strains exhibited remarkable polyextremotolerance, \nmaintaining viable growth and residual enzymatic activity under abiotic stress \nconditions (up to pH 12, 50\xa0°C, and 11% NaCl), beyond their optimal production \nrange. Beyond pectinolysis, all isolates co-produced key hydrolases, expressed \nplant-growth-promoting (PGP) traits (indole-3-acetic acid, siderophores, \nphosphate solubilization), and suppressed Fusarium and Aspergillus spp. This \nfirst report of alkaline-adapted B. amyloliquefaciens producing industrially \nrobust pectinase and exhibiting PGP potential highlights their promise as \ndual-purpose biocatalysts and bioinoculants for circular-bioeconomy \napplications.\n\n© 2025.

Three bacterial strains-Lactobacillus \nplantarum (BS-2), L. pentosus (BS-1), and L. paracasei (BS-3)-were involved for \nthe fermentation, individually and in combinations. Fortification with golden \nberry significantly enhanced the phytochemical profile, increasing phenolic \ncontent (22.97\u2009±\u20090.56\xa0mg GAE/g), flavonoids (97.15\u2009±\u20092.58\xa0mg QE/g), and \nantioxidant capacity compared to the control. The BS-2 strain exhibited the \nstrongest antifungal activity, inhibiting fungal growth by 53.8\u2009±\u20090.41% and \ncompletely suppressing the aflatoxin B2 production by Aspergillus parasiticus. \nRheological analysis showed that BS-2 and the three-strain mixture significantly \nincreased viscosity (p\u2009<\u20090.05), enhancing beverage stability. Sensory evaluation \n(n\u2009=\u200940) revealed that the BS-2 fermented Physalis-HPB was the most preferred, \nearning the highest overall score. During 21-day shelf-life tests under fungal \nchallenge, beverages fermented with BS-2 and mixed strains maintained the lowest \nfungal CFU counts at 4\xa0°C, demonstrating superior microbial stability. These \nfindings show that combining P. peruviana with probiotic fermentation enhances \nthe functional, sensory, and safety qualities of HPBs, suggesting a promising \nbio-based approach to reduce fungal spoilage and mycotoxin hazards in dairy \nbeverages.\n\n© 2025.

This study quantified \nbioaerosol concentrations during bronchoscopy to evaluate occupational exposure.\nMETHODOLOGY: Aerosol samples were collected during routine bronchoscopies in two \nhospitals using personal samplers with quartz filters attached to healthcare \nprofessional's clothing. Samples were cultured on various media, with bacterial \ncolonies identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and fungal colonies by ITS1-2 region \nsequencing. Respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, RSV) were detected \nvia RT-PCR.\nRESULTS: A total of 44 aerosol samples were collected: 7 pre-procedure, 32 \nduring bronchoscopy, and 5 between patients. From samples taken during \nbronchoscopies, 287 microbial colonies were isolated. The most abundant \nbacterial genera were Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Bacillus, while fungal \ngenera included Aspergillus, Talaromyces and Cladosporium. Several potentially \npathogenic species were identified, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Kocuria \nrosea, and Kroppenstedtia pulmonis, as well as some pathogenic fungi. A total of \n8 previously unsuspected SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were also detected. Our \nestimates suggest that an interventionalist, without protective equipment, could \nbe exposed to approximately 98.94 CFU/m3 during a typical procedure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopy generates aerosols containing microorganisms from the \noral, nasal, and pulmonary microbiota, as well as potential pathogens. These \naerosols can be inhaled by healthcare workers, representing a risk of \noccupational infection.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

Exploring these microorganisms for \nthe development of novel antimicrobial agents is increasingly important, \nparticularly given the escalating problem of multidrug resistance.\nOBJECTIVES: This study aimed to confirm the biosynthesis of selenium \nnanoparticles (SeNPs) by the Kocuria strain Bm3, isolated from the Hera \nmangroves in Iran, and to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of SeNPs in \ncombination with Chlorella vulgaris crude extract (C. vulgaris CE) against \nvarious bacterial strains.\nMETHODS: The synthesized SeNPs were characterized with respect to morphology and \nsize. Antimicrobial activity was assessed by measuring inhibition zones; minimum \ninhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) \nvalues were determined. Synergistic effects were calculated using the Fractional \nInhibitory Concentration Index (ΣFIC). Additionally, cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 \ncell lines were evaluated.\nRESULTS: The combination of C. vulgaris CE and SeNPs significantly enhanced \nantibacterial activity against various strains, most notably a clinical isolate \nof Escherichia coli, which exhibited marked growth inhibition and reduced MIC \nvalues (P < 0.001). While Staphylococcus aureus did not demonstrate significant \ndifferences among treatments, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus \nsaprophyticus showed improved sensitivity with the combination treatment, \nachieving substantial growth inhibition zones (P < 0.001). In contrast, the \nclinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii displayed potential resistance, with \nno growth inhibition observed when treated alone. The MTT assay revealed that C. \nvulgaris CE and SeNPs each exhibited low cytotoxicity individually, resulting in \nMCF-7 cell viability percentages of 49.75 ± 3.75% and 44.46 ± 4.26%, \nrespectively; however, their combination significantly reduced cell viability to \n29.36 ± 2.64% (P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The SeNPs synthesized by the Kocuria strain Bm3 significantly \nenhance the antimicrobial properties of C. vulgaris CE, indicating their \npotential as a therapeutic strategy against multidrug-resistant infections. \nFurther investigation into their cytotoxic effects is warranted to evaluate \nsafety and efficacy for clinical applications.\n\nCopyright © 2025, Babavalian et al.\n\nDOI: 10.5812/ijpr-164350\nPMCID: PMC12673754\nPMID: 41347222\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interests.'},

Carotenoids-natural pigments with potent antioxidant and \nanti-inflammatory properties-are emerging as promising agents for tissue repair. \nThis study explores the therapeutic potential of carotenoid pigments \nbiosynthesized by Kocuria sp. and their integration into a \nchitosan/alginate/polyvinyl alcohol (Cs/Alg/PVA) nanocomposite for wound healing \napplications. Carotenoids were extracted and optimized under varying conditions \nof temperature, salinity, pH, and culture media. The pigments were incorporated \ninto a Cs/Alg/PVA matrix and characterized using Fourier transform infrared \nspectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry \n(DSC), andin vitrorelease studies. Antioxidant capacity was evaluated via DPPH \nassay, and anti-inflammatory properties were assessed using hemolysis assays. \nCell viability and proliferation were analyzed on L929 and human dermal \nfibroblast cells using MTT assay.In vivowound healing efficacy was evaluated in \na murine excisional wound model with histological and morphometric analyses. The \ncarotenoid-enriched composite exhibited strong antioxidant activity, significant \nanti-hemolytic effects, and enhanced biocompatibility with fibroblasts. Release \nkinetics revealed sustained and pH-responsive delivery of carotenoids.In vivo, \nthe composite significantly accelerated wound contraction and epithelialization \ncompared to controls, with histopathological analysis confirming increased \nfibroblast presence, collagen deposition, and reduced inflammation. This study \nhighlights the therapeutic potential of microbial carotenoids embedded in \nCs/Alg/PVA dressings as a biocompatible, antioxidant-rich platform for enhanced \nwound healing. The approach offers a sustainable, natural alternative to \nsynthetic additives in wound care biomaterials.\n\n© 2025 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This study quantified \nbioaerosol concentrations during bronchoscopy to evaluate occupational exposure.\nMETHODOLOGY: Aerosol samples were collected during routine bronchoscopies in two \nhospitals using personal samplers with quartz filters attached to healthcare \nprofessional's clothing. Samples were cultured on various media, with bacterial \ncolonies identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and fungal colonies by ITS1-2 region \nsequencing. Respiratory viruses (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B, RSV) were detected \nvia RT-PCR.\nRESULTS: A total of 44 aerosol samples were collected: 7 pre-procedure, 32 \nduring bronchoscopy, and 5 between patients. From samples taken during \nbronchoscopies, 287 microbial colonies were isolated. The most abundant \nbacterial genera were Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Bacillus, while fungal \ngenera included Aspergillus, Talaromyces and Cladosporium. Several potentially \npathogenic species were identified, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Kocuria \nrosea, and Kroppenstedtia pulmonis, as well as some pathogenic fungi. A total of \n8 previously unsuspected SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were also detected. Our \nestimates suggest that an interventionalist, without protective equipment, could \nbe exposed to approximately 98.94 CFU/m3 during a typical procedure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Bronchoscopy generates aerosols containing microorganisms from the \noral, nasal, and pulmonary microbiota, as well as potential pathogens. These \naerosols can be inhaled by healthcare workers, representing a risk of \noccupational infection.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

We isolated 11 non-redundant isolates \nassociated with Bacillus, Enterococcus, Kosakonia and Kocuria from Agave \ntequilana seeds, identified by MALDI-TOF MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

Time-resolved SEM documented OMV \nrelease and cell aggregation within 9 h, followed by mature biofilms at 24 h \nwith continued vesiculation. Purified OMVs (≈80-300 nm) contained extracellular \nDNA and were characterized by dynamic light scattering and UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS \nlipidomics. The OMV lipidome was dominated by phosphatidylethanolamine (~80%) \nand was enriched in monounsaturated fatty acids (16:1, 18:1), while the \nstress-associated cyclopropane fatty acids (17:1, 19:1) were comparatively \nretained in the whole-cell membranes; OMVs also exhibited reduced ubiquinone-8. \nSEA01 is catalase-negative, uncommon among plant-associated Enterobacter, \nsuggesting a testable model in which oxidative factors modulate OMV output and \nbiofilm assembly. These may have implications for recognition and redox \nsignaling at the root interface.

Despite attempts at sink drain \nbiofilm disinfection and removal, drain biofilms inevitably regrow, and \ndisinfection may shape the returning microbial communities and their resistance \nprofiles. We applied culture-based and metagenomic approaches to study these \ndrain disinfection effects on microbial community abundance, taxonomy, and \nantimicrobial resistance in operational hospital sinks. Drain biofilms regrew to \nbaseline densities in approximately four days. Regrown biofilms contained more \nviable carbapenem-resistant bacteria and were dominated by Pseudomonadota, \nincluding Cupriavidus and Pseudomonas . Long-read sequencing revealed an \nincrease in multidrug efflux pump genes after disinfection, which confer broad \nresistance to antibiotics and disinfectants. This work provides mechanistic \ninsights into how disinfection influences sink drain biofilm ecology and the \nenrichment of antimicrobial resistance, with implications for infection \nprevention strategies in healthcare environments.\n\nDOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-7888495/v1\nPMCID: PMC12636743\nPMID: 41282070'},

This study characterized 30 d biofilm \nassembly dynamics on polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA), and biodegradable \npoly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)/polylactic acid (BP) in simulated \nwastewater treatment systems. Integrated multi-parametric analyses revealed \ncyclic di-guanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) as a key biomarker of biofilm \nmaturity, peaking at 15-22 d alongside maximal biomass and extracellular \npolymeric substances (EPS). Subsequent detachment was mediated by β-glucosidase \nand lysozyme, inducing autolysis. Stage-specific transitions included: Initial \nattachment (0-10 d); Microbial colonization (10-22 d); Maturation/Detachment \n(post-22 d). EPS-secreting and plastic-degrading taxa (Pseudomonas and \nRhodotorula) facilitated initial attachment, followed by functional taxa \nmediating nitrogen transformation (Ochrobactrum, Aminobacter, and Cupriavidus) \nand potential biofilm-stabilizing fungi (Rozellomycota-gen-incertae-sedis). PA \nenhanced colonization via amide-driven nitrogen enrichment and elevated c-di-GMP \nlevels, leading to robust biofilms with functional consortia (Zavarzinia, \nSphingopyxis, and Rozellomycota-gen-incertae-sedis). Conversely, BP promoted \ninitial bacterial recruitment (Pseudomonas and Enterobacter) but later inhibited \nsustained growth because of cytotoxic leachates and nutrient competition, \ncausing biomass decline and fungal inhibition at 20 d. These findings elucidated \nplastisphere succession pathways, enabling more accurate assessment of their \necological impact and improved MP pollution management strategies in wastewater \ntreatment.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we assessed the combined treatment of ozone and \nslurry ice (referred to as SIO) as a preservation strategy at 4\xa0°C, integrating \nphysicochemical, structural and microbiome analyses. Compared with conventional \nicing, SIO markedly suppressed increases in total volatile basic nitrogen, K \nvalue, and total viable count. Meanwhile, SIO preserved inosine monophosphate by \ninhibiting acid phosphatase activity, while mitigating protein degradation to \nmaintain myofibrillar integrity. High-throughput sequencing revealed that SIO \ndecreased the relative abundance of Cupriavidus, and suppressed the \nproliferation of spoilage-associated genera Psychrobacter, Vibrio, and \nShewanella. The K value in the CK group exceeded 60\xa0% by day 5, whereas SIO \npostponed this threshold to day 7, effectively extending shelf life by 2\xa0days. \nThese findings demonstrate that SIO provides synergistic microbial suppression \nand biochemical stabilization, offering a scalable, residue-free approach for \nmaintaining the quality of seafood.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

Despite attempts at sink drain \nbiofilm disinfection and removal, drain biofilms inevitably regrow, and \ndisinfection may shape the returning microbial communities and their resistance \nprofiles. We applied culture-based and metagenomic approaches to study these \ndrain disinfection effects on microbial community abundance, taxonomy, and \nantimicrobial resistance in operational hospital sinks. Drain biofilms regrew to \nbaseline densities in approximately four days. Regrown biofilms contained more \nviable carbapenem-resistant bacteria and were dominated by Pseudomonadota, \nincluding Cupriavidus and Pseudomonas . Long-read sequencing revealed an \nincrease in multidrug efflux pump genes after disinfection, which confer broad \nresistance to antibiotics and disinfectants.

Electronic address: Lambrou@aua.gr.\n\nPolyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) depolymerases (PHBds) enable bioplastic degradation \ninto reusable monomers, making them essential for sustainable waste management \nand circular bioeconomy solutions. In this study, we computationally identified \nand characterized two new PHBds from Cupriavidus malaysiensis (CmaPHBd) and from \nPseudomonas guguanensis (PguPHBd). Sequence analysis revealed that both enzymes \nare classified as extracellular type I depolymerases, containing a conserved \nN-terminal catalytic domain (CD) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain \n(SBD). Recombinant expression in E. coli enabled purification and biochemical \ncharacterization of CmaPHBd and PguPHBd. The results demonstrated that CmaPHBd \nwas most active in acidic conditions (pH 5.0-6.0), while PguPHBd exhibited \noptimum activity in alkaline conditions (pH 9.5). Differential scanning \nfluorimetry (DSF) analysis indicated a melting temperature (Tm) of 49.6\xa0°C for \nCmaPHBd, while PguPHBd exhibited two unfolding transitions at 45.7\xa0°C and \n57.1\xa0°C. Initial rate kinetics analysis indicated an allosteric regulation in \nboth enzymes and significant substrate inhibition at high PHB concentrations. \nAmong the two enzymes, CmaPHBd exhibited superior degradation efficiency towards \nsolid PHB films. Furthermore, CmaPHBd displayed promiscuous activity against \nother solid polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) films. A domain-shuffling strategy was \nemployed, to enhance the activity PguPHBd towards solid plastic films, by fusing \nthe SBD of CmaPHBd to the CD of PguPHBd. The engineered variant, showed improved \ndegradation efficiency on PHB and related biopolymers, confirming the critical \nrole of SBD in overcoming the rate-limiting adsorption step towards solid \nplastic films. These findings provide valuable insights into the structural and \nfunctional properties of CmaPHBd and PguPHBd, highlighting their potential \napplication in bioplastic degradation, reusability and biocatalysis.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

Expression \nof the operon from plasmids or from a copy integrated in the chromosome enabled \ngrowth of an energy-auxotrophic selection strain on formate as sole energy \nsource under aerobic conditions. Growth could be accelerated in turbidostat, \nleading to a drop of the generation time of 1 hour. While no mutation was found \nin the operon of evolved isolates, genome sequencing revealed non-synonymous \npoint mutations in the gene focA coding for a bidirectional formate transporter \ncarried in all isolates sequenced. Reverting the mutations led to a drop in the \ngrowth rate demonstrating the focA gene as principal target of continuous \nculture adaptation.\nSIGNIFICANCE: A member of the oxygen-tolerant subclass of complex FDH showed \nstable formate oxidation activity when expressed in the heterologous host E. \ncoli, a model organism of biotechnology. The integration of the operon in the \nchromosome offers the possibility of structure/function studies and activity \nenhancements through in vivo mutagenesis, which can also be applied to CO2 \nreduction in appropriate selection hosts.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 Schulz et al.

In this study, we focused \non improving GE2270A production through heterologous expression of the \nbiosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in the model organism Streptomyces coelicolor \nM1146. A statistically significant yield improvement was obtained in the S. \ncoelicolor system through the data-driven rational engineering of the BGC, \nincluding the introduction of additional copies of key biosynthetic and \nregulatory genes. However, despite our best efforts, the highest production \nlevel observed in the strains generated in this study is 12×\xa0lower than \npublished titres achieved in the natural producer and 50×\xa0lower than published \ntitres obtained using Nonomuraea ATCC 39727 as expression host. These results \nsuggest that, while using the most genetically amenable strain as host can be \nthe right choice when exploring different BGC designs, the choice of the most \nsuitable host has a major effect on the achievable yield and should be carefully \nconsidered. The analysis of the multiomics data obtained in this study suggests \nan important role of PbtX in GE2270A biosynthesis and provides insights into the \ndifferences in production metabolic profiles between the different strains.

Here, an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) \nSR25 is characterized, which effectively kills both Gram-negative and \nGram-positive bacteria through a unique dual-targeting mechanism without \ndetectable resistance.

In a \ndiabetic mice wound infection model, the SR25-incorporated hydrogel exhibits \nhigh efficacy against mixed infections of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and \nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), accelerating wound healing. \nOverall, these findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SR25 and \nhighlight the value of mining drugs with multiple mechanisms from uncultured \nanimal commensals for combating challenging bacterial pathogens.\n\n© 2024 The Author(s).

To investigate whether Ramo5 \nand Chers28, given their phylogenetic positions, might influence the \nbiosynthesis of other antibiotic pathways governed by StrR-like PSRs, the \ncorresponding genes (ramo5 and chers28) were heterologously expressed in \nActinoplanes teichomyceticus NRRL B-16726 and Nonomuraea gerenzanensis ATCC \n39727, which produce the clinically-relevant GPAs teicoplanin and A40926, \nrespectively. Recombinant strains of NRRL B-16726 and ATCC 39727 expressing \nchers28 exhibited improved antibiotic production, although the expression of \nramo5 did not yield the same effect. These results demonstrate that some \nStrR-like PSRs can "cross-talk" between distant biosynthetic pathways and might \nbe utilized as tools for the activation of silent BGCs regulated by StrR-like \nPSRs.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/antibiotics13020115\nPMCID: PMC10886168\nPMID: 38391501\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'},

Based on the 16S rRNA gene \nsequences, the new isolate was closely related to Nonomuraea harbinensis \nDSM45887T (99.2%) and Nonomuraea ferruginea DSM43553T (98.6%). Phylogenetic \nanalyzes based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain MCN248T was \nclustered with Nonomuraea harbinensis DSM45887T and Nonomuraea ferruginea \nDSM43553T. However, the digital DNA-DNA hybridization analyzes presented a low \nrelatedness of 40.2% between strain MCN248T and the above closely related \nstrains. This strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The acyl type of the \npeptidoglycan was acetyl, and mycolic acids were absent. The major menaquinones \nwere MK-9(H2) and MK-9(H4). The whole cell sugars consisted of madurose, ribose, \nmannose, and glucose. Diphosphatidylglycerol, hydroxyl-phosphatidylethanolamine, \nphosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylglycerol were \ndetected as the major phospholipids. The predominant cellular fatty acids were \niso-C16:0 (40.4%), 10-methyl-C17:0 (22.1%), and C17:1ω8c (10.9%). The DNA G\u2009+\u2009C \ncontent of the genomic DNA was 71.7%. With in silico analyzes, the antiSMASH \nplatform uncovered a diverse 29 secondary metabolite biosynthesis arsenal, \nincluding non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) \nof strain MCN248T, with a high prevalence of gene cluster encoding pathways for \nthe production of anticancer and cytotoxic compounds. Consistently, the crude \nextract could inhibit colorectal HCT-116 cancer cells at a final concentration \nof 50\u2009μg/mL. Based on the polyphasic approach, strain MCN248 was designated as a \nnovel species of the genus Nonomuraea, for which the name Nonomuraea corallina \nsp. nov. is proposed.

Our \nfindings reveal that soil from the Mingyong Glacier landscape contains a diverse \nrange of actinomyces which may hold potential for isolating medicinal and \npharmaceutical compounds. We also highlight the importance of isolating novel \nActinomycetota lineages for drug discovery and the development of new therapies, \nstressing the role of genome mining and synthetic biology. Overall, this study \nprovides valuable insights into the diversity and biotechnological prospects of \nactinomycetes from extreme environment paving the way for advancements in \nmicrobial-based drug discovery.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material \navailable at 10.1007/s12088-025-01449-0.\n\n© Association of Microbiologists of India 2025.

With the advent of genome-based taxonomic \napproaches and integrated genomic metrics, including sequence similarity and \nphylogenomic frameworks, it has become essential to reevaluate the taxonomic \nstatus of older taxa defined before the era of genome-based microbial taxonomy. \nApplying these modern genomic criteria enables a more accurate assessment of \nspecies boundaries and helps to determine whether the old taxa represent \ndistinct species or should be reclassified as synonyms, subspecies, or members \nof different genera. Such reclassification efforts are crucial for ensuring \ntaxonomic accuracy, improving the reliability of comparative genomics, and \nmaintaining stable and evolutionariy meaningful nomenclature. In this study, we \nre-evaluated the taxonomy of Nonomuraea using genome-based methods, including \ndigital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), average nucleotide identity (FastANI), \naverage amino acid identity (AAI), and percentage of conserved proteins (POCP) \nanalyses, complemented by phylogenomic analysis. Based on comprehensive genomic \nstudies, our results support the elevation of both Nonomuraea roseoviolacea \nsubsp. carminata and Nonomuraea roseoviolacea subsp. roseoviolacea to an unified \nspecies without subspecies distinction: Nonomuraea roseoviolacea (ATCC \n27297T\u2009=\u2009BCRC 13406T\u2009=\u2009CBS 260.72T\u2009=\u2009CCM 3491T\u2009=\u2009CCRC 13406T\u2009=\u2009CGMCC \n4.1072T\u2009=\u2009CIP 106924T\u2009=\u2009DSM 43144T\u2009=\u2009IFO 14098T\u2009=\u2009IMET 9751T\u2009=\u2009JCM 3145T\u2009=\u2009KCTC \n9283T\u2009=\u2009NBRC 14098T\u2009=\u2009NCIB 11117T\u2009=\u2009NCIMB 11117T\u2009=\u2009NRRL B-16127T\u2009=\u2009VKM Ac-909T). \nFurthermore, we propose the reclassification of Nonomuraea recticatena, \nNonomuraea roseola and Nonomuraea dietziae as subspecies within N. roseola. \nConsequently, we propose the establishment of the following two subspecies: \nNonomuraea roseola subsp. roseola subsp. nov.

Tobacco is an important commercial crop, and the \nmethods used for seedling cultivation significantly influence the rhizosphere \nsoil microenvironment. Compared to conventional seedling practices, the use of \nagricultural waste-such as sunflower straw-to fabricate biodegradable nursery \ncontainers represents an environmentally friendly alternative technology. This \napproach may exert specific potential effects on the structure and function of \nmicrobial communities in the tobacco rhizosphere. In this study, Yunyan-301 was \nused as the test material, and field experiments were carried out at two test \nsites (BT and HCZ). Each site included two treatments: conventional seedling \ncultivation (CK) and sunflower straw-based natural bowl seedling cultivation \n(T). While tobacco was harvested, a rhizosphere soil sample of tobacco was \ncollected for microbial analysis. The results showed that sunflower straw-based \nnatural bowl seedling cultivation led to a less diverse but functionally \nspecialized microbial community. The specific alterations in the abundance of \ncore taxa (e.g., Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Sphingomonas, Pseudoduganella, \nLuteitalea) suggest a potential ecological advantage, where the enriched \ncommunity may be more efficient in utilizing sunflower straw-derived compounds \nand providing host-beneficial functions. Predictions of microbial community \nfunctions revealed that sunflower straw-based natural bowl seedling cultivation \nsignificantly enhanced the capacity of carbon fixation and oxidative \nphosphorylation, effectively improving the metabolic activity and carbon cycling \nability of tobacco rhizosphere microbes. In summary, sunflower straw-based \nnatural bowl seedling cultivation effectively alter the microenvironment of \ntobacco rhizosphere soil, thereby enriching functional microbial taxa and \nrelated metabolic pathways that were beneficial to soil health and tobacco \ngrowth. However, its effect was modulated by the environmental background of the \ntest sites. In future research and actual production, further optimization of \nthe sunflower straw-based natural bowl seedling cultivation should be conducted, \nand attempts should be made to assist in green and sustainable tobacco \ncultivation from the perspective of microbial community management.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Shi, Ge, Hou, Han, Xu, Jiang and Ma.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1661023\nPMCID: PMC12546116\nPMID: 41140400\n\nConflict of interest statement: XM was employed by China National Tobacco \nCorporation Liaoning Provincial Company.

The highest extracellular \ncatalase activity-possessing Pseudoduganella aquatica HC52 was chosen among 36 \nculturable symbiotic isolates from the phycosphere in freshly collected M. \naeruginosa cells. A zymogram for catalase activity revealed the presence of only \none extracellular catalase despite the four putative catalase genes (katA1, \nkatA2, katE, and srpA) identified in the newly sequenced genome (∼6.8 Mb) of P. \naquatica HC52. Analysis of secreted catalase using liquid chromatography-tandem \nmass spectrometry was identified as KatA1, which lacks a typical signal peptide, \nalthough the underlying mechanism for its secretion is unknown. The expression \nof secreted KatA1 appeared to be induced in the presence of H2O2. Proteomic \nanalysis also confirmed the presence of KatA1 inside the outer membrane vesicles \nsecreted by P. aquatica HC52 following exposure to H2O2. High light intensities \n(> 100 µmol m-2 s-1) are known to kill catalase-less axenic M. aeruginosa cells, \nbut the present study found that the presence of P. aquatica cells supported the \ngrowth of M. aeruginosa, while the extracellular catalases in supernatant or \npurified form also sustained the growth of M. aeruginosa under the same \nconditions. Our results suggest that the extracellular catalase secreted by P. \naquatica HC52 enhances the tolerance of M. aeruginosa to H2O2, thus promoting \nthe formation of M. aeruginosa blooms under high light intensities.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

The isolate \nwas Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, motile, rod-shaped, cream-coloured, oxidase- \nand catalase-positive. Strain SM-13\xa0T grew at the range of 15-37\xa0°C (optimum, \n25\xa0°C), at pH 6.0-9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0), and in the presence of 0-0.5%\u2009(w/v) \nNaCl (optimum, 0%). Phylogenetic analysis based on genome and 16S rRNA gene \nsequences indicated that strain SM-13\xa0T was affiliated with the family \nOxalobacteriaceae and most closely related to Pseudoduganella humi THG S6-8\xa0T \n(97.8%), Pseudoduganella violacea CAVIOT (97.7%), Pseudoduganella buxea A9T \n(97.6%), Pseudoduganella dura 16\xa0T (97.5%), Pseudoduganella umbonata LP01T \n(97.5%), and Pseudoduganella lurida D5T (97.4%). The major ubiquinone was Q-8. \nThe major identified polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), \nphosphatidylglycerol (PG), diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), amino lipids (AL), and \nunknown lipids (L1, L2). The major fatty acids of SM-13\xa0T were summed feature 3 \n(C16:1 ω7c/C16:1 ω6c) (51.9%) and C16:\u200a0 (18.7%).

The highest extracellular \ncatalase activity-possessing Pseudoduganella aquatica HC52 was chosen among 36 \nculturable symbiotic isolates from the phycosphere in freshly collected M. \naeruginosa cells. A zymogram for catalase activity revealed the presence of only \none extracellular catalase despite the four putative catalase genes (katA1, \nkatA2, katE, and srpA) identified in the newly sequenced genome (∼6.8 Mb) of P. \naquatica HC52. Analysis of secreted catalase using liquid chromatography-tandem \nmass spectrometry was identified as KatA1, which lacks a typical signal peptide, \nalthough the underlying mechanism for its secretion is unknown. The expression \nof secreted KatA1 appeared to be induced in the presence of H2O2. Proteomic \nanalysis also confirmed the presence of KatA1 inside the outer membrane vesicles \nsecreted by P. aquatica HC52 following exposure to H2O2. High light intensities \n(> 100 µmol m-2 s-1) are known to kill catalase-less axenic M. aeruginosa cells, \nbut the present study found that the presence of P. aquatica cells supported the \ngrowth of M. aeruginosa, while the extracellular catalases in supernatant or \npurified form also sustained the growth of M. aeruginosa under the same \nconditions. Our results suggest that the extracellular catalase secreted by P. \naquatica HC52 enhances the tolerance of M. aeruginosa to H2O2, thus promoting \nthe formation of M. aeruginosa blooms under high light intensities.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

This \nresults in the transfer of 35 Massilia species to the genus Telluria.

Cross-validation of EC code data compared within \ncanonical plots validated the reclassifications and correctly visualized the \nexpected genus-level taxonomic relationships. The approach is complementary to \ngenome-wide methodology and could be used for testing sequence alignment based \ndata across genetically related genera.

Comparisons based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strains \nFT55WT, FT93WT and CY13WT take strain Pseudoduganella danionis E3/2T, and strain \nDS3T takes strain Pseudoduganella eburnea 10R5-21T as their closest neighbour, \nrespectively. The genome sizes of strains FT55WT, FT93WT, CY13WT and DS3T were \n6.15, 5.10, 5.31 and 5.72 Mbp with G+C contents of 61.7, 60.9, 60.6 and 64.0%, \nrespectively. The reconstructed phylogenomic tree based on concatenated 92 core \ngenes showed that strain FT55WT clusters closely with Duganella radicis KCTC \n22382T and Duganella sacchari Sac-22T, strains FT93WT and CY13WT form a distinct \nclade with P. danionis DSM 103461T and this clade clusters with the clades of \ngenus Duganella together, and strain DS3T forms a distinct clade with P. eburnea \nJCM 31587T and Pseudoduganella violaceinigra DSM 15887T and this clade clusters \nclosely with the clades of genus Massilia, respectively. The calculated pairwise \nOrthoANIu values and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values among strains \nFT55WT, FT93WT, CY13WT, DS3T and related strains were in the ranges of \n75.6-94.2% and 20.6-56.2%, respectively. Q-8 was the sole respiratory quinone of \nthese four strains. The major fatty acids were C16:1ω7c, C16:0 and C12:0. The \npolar lipids included phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and one \nunidentified phospholipid. Considering the similar fatty acids and polar lipids \nprofiles of species within genus Pseudoduganella, Massilia and Duganella, there \nis currently no justification for assigning the species of genus Pseudoduganella \ninto the Massilia and Duganella clades in the phylogenomic tree.

Considering \nphylogenomic analysis, OrthoANIu data, digital DDH data and a range of \nphysiological and biochemical characteristics, strains FT55WT, FT93WT and CY13WT \nshould be assigned to genus Duganella, and strain DS3T should be classified as a \nnovel species within genus Massilia, for which the names Duganella rivus sp. \nnov.

The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, termed central \ntrained immunity, remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that infection \ninduces histone modifications leading to changes in chromatin accessibility that \nare conserved during differentiation from HSPCs to myeloid progenitors and \nmonocytes. We conducted genome-wide surveillance of histone marks H3K27ac and \nH3K4me3 and chromatin accessibility in hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent \nprogenitor 3, granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, monocytes and macrophages of \nnaïve and Mycobacterium avium infected mice. Interferon signaling pathways and \nrelated transcription factor binding motifs including IRFs, NF-κB, and CEBP \nshowed increased activating histone marks and chromatin accessibility across \ncell types. However, histone marks and increased chromatin accessibility were \nconserved at only a few loci, notably Irf1 and Gbp6. Knock out of IRF1 disrupted \nenhanced mitochondrial respiration and bacterial killing in human monocyte cell \nlines, while GBP6 KO monocyte cell lines showed dysregulated mitochondrial \nrespiration. In summary, this study identifies IRF1 and GBP6 as two key loci at \nwhich infection-induced systemic inflammation leads to epigenetic changes that \nare conserved from HSPCs to downstream monocytes, providing a mechanistic avenue \nfor central trained immunity.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.193686\nPMID: 41364527"},

Still, the inflation in bedaquiline resistance has \nalarmed the global public health crisis, indicating the need for a new treatment \nstrategy. Several scientific studies have reported a high incidence of \nresistance among MDR-TB patients who had prior exposure to bedaquiline for \ntreating Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Disparate research findings \nindicate that individuals previously administered this drug exhibit a remarkable \nprevalence of resistance. Studies have further demonstrated that prior treatment \noften correlates with the emergence of resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis \nstrains. Overall, evidence from multiple investigations highlights a concerning \ntrend of increased resistance in MDR-TB cases with a history of bedaquiline \ntherapy. Moreover, bedaquiline resistance in MDR-TB strains has been linked to \nmutations in several chromosomal genes, including atpE, Rv0677c, Rv0678, and \npepQ. Consequently, it is imperative to mitigate the burden of MDR-TB and \nbedaquiline resistance. Herein, this article emphasizes structural features, \nmechanism of action, emergence of underlying resistance mechanisms, \npharmacokinetic & pharmacodynamic properties, clinical toxicity, and strategies \nto combat resistance associated with bedaquiline.\n\n© 2025.

There are different diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of \nbovine tuberculosis, among which, determination of biomarkers plays a \nsignificant role. However, the biomarkers for the diagnosis of bTB in naturally \ninfected cattle are limited.\nMETHODS: In the present study, the gene expression profile of host \nimmune-related genes (MCP-1, MMP-9, CCR5, iNOS, IFNγ, TNFα, and IL-23A) was \nstudied. The aim of the study was to evaluate this set of immune-related genes \nfor their potential use as diagnostic biomarkers of bTB infection in cattle. A \ntotal of 40 HF cross-breed cattle were grouped into two groups uninfected, and \nbTB infected, on the basis of results obtained by CITT, IS6100 PCR. The PBMCs \nfrom both groups were cultured and stimulated in vitro with bovine tuberculin \nPPD.\nRESULTS: In the results, the mRNAs (MCP-1, MMP-9, CCR5, iNOS, IFNγ, TNFα and \nIL-23A) were upregulated in bTB-positive animals relative to negative controls. \nThe transcripts can discriminate between bTB-positives and uninfected controls, \nwith AUC ranging from 0.8 to 1. The targeted genes showed promising results and \nfurther studies are needed to explore the potential of these highly expressed \ntranscripts as the potential biomarker of bTB in naturally infected cattle.\n\n© 2025.

TB-induced chronic inflammation, oxidative \nstress, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and immune checkpoint \ndysregulation create a permissive environment for oncogenesis.

This review integrates \ncurrent evidence on the overlapping pathogenic, immunological and molecular \nlandscapes of TB and lung cancer to identify shared mechanisms, diagnostic \ndilemmas and therapeutic challenges, while highlighting significant gaps needing \nactionable interventions.

In addition to socio-environmental factors, it is \nwidely believed that host genetic factors, particularly polymorphisms within the \nhuman leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, may play an extensive role in the \nlikelihood of a host's TB infection. Studies on the influence of HLA class I \nalleles (HLA-A, -B, -C) in human susceptibility to TB reported contradictory \nresults. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aim to see the \nassociation of HLA class I alleles with susceptibility to TB in humans. In this \nmeta-analysis, the literature was searched using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and \nGoogle Scholar, until 23rd May 2025. A total of 13 eligible case-control studies \nwere included, comprising 1951\xa0TB cases and 2109 matched healthy controls. \nTogether with a 95% Confidence interval, pooled odds ratio was calculated for \neach allele. To evaluate heterogeneity I2 statistic was used. Sensitivity and \nsubgroup analyses were also performed. Publication bias was investigated using \nEgger's and Begg's tests. The analysis results demonstrated 40 HLA class I \nalleles (12-A, 22-B, 6-C). HLA-A32 (OR\u2009=\u20091.67, 95% CI= 1.09-2.56, p\u2009=\u20090.0191) \nand B58 (OR\u2009=\u20091.45, 95% CI= 1.02-2.07, p\u2009=\u20090.0404) found to be associated with \nincreased TB risk, while HLA-A1 (OR\u2009=\u20090.70, 95% CI= 0.57-0.85; p\u2009=\u20090.0007) \nshowed a protective trend after analysis. Sensitivity analysis strengthened the \nsignificance of all different alleles. Regional variations emerged: B58 was a \nrisk allele in Africa, and A32 was a risk allele in Asia. HLA-B15 and B35 were \nreported to have a statistically significantly increased risk in North America. \nPost-sensitivity analysis revealed possible publication bias, as HLA-B17 shifted \nfrom susceptibility to a protective effect. This is the first meta-analysis that \nsystematically evaluates the associations between HLA class I alleles and TB \nsusceptibility. Our findings determine selective associations at both the allele \nand regional levels. The findings of this study can inform future studies in \nimmunogenetics and aid in formulating solutions for the prevention and treatment \nof TB that are tailored to individual alleles.\n\n© 2025.

Early diagnosis of TB is the \nmost essential component to control TB. In this study, we evaluated the \ndiagnostic performance of SD Bioline TB Ag MPT64 (SD Bioline) and BD MGIT TBc \nIdentification (BD TBc ID) kits for the detection of MTBC from MGIT \n(Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube) 960 culture tube, positive for acid-fast \nbacilli (AFB).\nMETHODS: A total of 198 AFB positive MGIT cultures [MTBC, 150 and \nnon-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), 48] were collected during the study period \n(April 2021 to March 2023) and subjected to SD Bioline and BD TBc ID assays, \nrespectively. All the 150 MTBC positive cultures were confirmed by multiplex PCR \ntargeting MPB64, protein B and IS6110 genes, and the 48 NTM cultures were \nspeciated by using line probe assays technique- Genotype Mycobacterium CM assay.\nRESULTS: SD Bioline and BD TBc ID kits detected all 150 MTBC strains correctly \nfrom MGIT positive cultures and no false negative was observed. However, there \nwas one false positive for M. abscessus by SD Bioline and two false positive \nresults for M. abscessus and M. intracellulare each by BD TBc ID. Overall, the \nsensitivity of both SD Bioline and BD TBc ID tests was 100\xa0% and specificity was \n97.9\xa0% and 95.8\xa0%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: Our results highlighted that SD Bioline and BD TBc ID assays played \na promising role in the earlier identification of MTBC present in liquid culture \nand may act as a potential alternative to biochemical and expensive molecular \ntechniques.\n\nCopyright © 2023 Tuberculosis Association of India.

Timely diagnosis of tuberculosis is crucial, and the \nconventional culture method is time-consuming and smear microscopic staining is \nless sensitive. Significantly, rapid molecular diagnostic assays are frequently \nused to detect this infection with high sensitivity and specificity. However, \ntuberculosis and associated ailments have been identified by several \ntuberculosis marker proteins. A range of biosensing methodologies, such as \nnucleic acid amplification tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), \nflow cytometry, radiometric detection, and latex agglutination have been \nutilized to enhance tuberculosis diagnosis. Majorly, the detection of two \nbiomarkers in Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli prominently produce a 10\xa0kDa \nculture filtrate antigen (CFP-10) and a 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target \n(ESAT-6). In this context, Nanoparticle-based biosensors make it easier to find \ndifferent stages of disease development. In recent years, it has been strongly \nlinked to tubercular disease diagnoses. Nanoparticles are likely to be inorganic \nand organic, and predominantly inorganic (Silver, Gold, zinc oxide, iron oxide, \nand silica) nanoparticles have been well studied. Notably, antibacterials are \nmade from gold and silver nanoparticles that are made from vegetable oil. \nTherefore, this review aims to comprehensively analyze the recent developments \nof nanoparticle-based diagnostics advances to detect tuberculosis.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Tuberculosis Association of India.

What makes these infections \nunique is that they are environmentally acquired, yet there remains a limited \nunderstanding of how different environments contribute to potential pathogen \nexposure. Here, we use new and existing marker gene data sets to compare the \namounts and types of NTM across three environments known to harbor mycobacteria, \nsurface waters, soil, and household plumbing biofilms, to better understand \npotential pathogen occurrence in each environment. We used 16S rRNA gene \nsequencing, in tandem with mycobacterial-specific marker gene sequencing, to \ncharacterize variation in the relative abundances of the genus Mycobacterium and \nspecific mycobacterial taxa across the three environments, with a focus on a \nclinically significant NTM. We found that household plumbing biofilms contained \nboth the highest relative abundance of the genus Mycobacterium (on average, \n13.7% of bacteria were members of the genus), as well as the highest occurrence \nof clinically relevant species detected (Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium \nabscessus), compared to surface waters and soil. Although mycobacteria are \nubiquitous across many different environments, mycobacterial diversity is highly \nvariable between environments with clinically relevant species largely \nrestricted to household plumbing biofilms, information that is critical for \nunderstanding the ecology and epidemiology of NTM \ndisease.IMPORTANCENontuberculous mycobacteria, or NTM, are a diverse group of \nbacteria within the genus Mycobacterium that are common in many environments. \nWhile most members of the genus pose little threat to human health, a handful of \nspecies, namely the Mycobacterium avium complex, M. abscessus, and M. kansasii, \ncan cause severe and prolonged lung infections. These environmentally acquired \ninfections are on the rise in the United States and around the world, yet we \nstill do not have a good understanding of which environment types pose the \ngreatest risk of infection to susceptible populations. Our study used \ncultivation-independent approaches to identify the specific NTM taxa found in \nover 1,000 samples from three potentially important environmental \nreservoirs-surface waters, soils, and household plumbing systems, to determine \nwhich of these environments are most likely to harbor NTM of clinical \nsignificance. Our results highlight the high degree of variability in the types \nof NTM taxa detected in different environments (including extensive novel \ndiversity within the genus) and show that household plumbing biofilms are likely \nthe most important reservoir and subsequent route of transmission for clinically \nsignificant NTM.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/aem.01552-25\nPMID: 41358737'}],

Although Cm and amikacin (Am) are \nhistorically grouped as second-line injectable drugs (SLIDs) with shared \nresistance mechanisms (e.g., rrs mutations), recent clinical and genetic data \nsuggests divergent evolutionary pathways. It remains unclear how Mtb evolves \nfrom sensitive to resistant phenotypes under Cm pressure. In this study, we \ngenerate in vitro drug-resistant Mtb models to systematically study the \nevolutionary mechanisms of Cm and Am cross-resistance. By integrating \ntranscriptome/proteome/metabolome analyses, we identify both genetic mutations \nand non-genetic factors contributing to Cm resistance. We show that Cm- and \nAm-selective pressures trigger independent cross-resistance mechanisms revealed \nby distinct genetic mutations. Gly232AsptlyA and Trp120fstlyA mutations are \ndirectly associated with low level resistance to Cm, whereas Ala48ValmmaA2, \nGln19ArgrpmA and variant at the promoter of eis (which encodes an \nN-acetyltransferase; c.-14c>t) mediate cross-resistance pathways specific to Cm \nselection. In addition, dysregulations of non-genetic factors including metal \nions transportations and lipids metabolism also lead to drug-resistance. In \nsummary, our findings systematically characterize the molecular mechanisms of Cm \nresistance, demonstrating that the "genetic factors" (DNA mutations) are often \nthe drivers that induce the stable "non-genetic factors" (dysregulated pathways, \nsuch as eis overexpression, metal ion transport, and metabolic reprogramming), \nwhich ultimately mediate the resistance phenotype. These insights uncover the \nevolutionary trajectory of Cm and Am cross-resistance and provide potential \nstrategies for optimizing Cm use to treat MDR-TB.\nIMPORTANCE: Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is responsible \nfor the highest mortality rate worldwide among single pathogen infections. The \ndiagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis pose a global challenge. \nCapreomycin (Cm) is one of the drugs utilized in the management of \nmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant \ntuberculosis (XDR-TB). Currently, the clinical detection of mutations in rrs \ngene is employed to identify Cm resistance. However, the sensitivity and \nspecificity of this method are suboptimal. To further investigate the mechanisms \nunderlying Cm resistance, this study established a microevolution model in \nvitro, thereby simulating the progression of MTB from susceptible strains to \ndrug-resistant strains. The genomes of each generation were sequenced throughout \nthe evolutionary process. In addition, the transcriptome-proteome-lipid \nmetabolome analysis of representative strains were performed. Our findings \nreveal that Cm resistance is a combinatory effect of both genetic and \nnon-genetic changes, providing potential optimization strategies to the \nmolecular drug sensitivity testing used in clinical practice.\n\n© 2025 The Authors.

Methods: The clinical data of a patient with GATA2 \ndeficiency-associated PAP and splenic M. kansasii disease admitted to Peking \nUniversity People's Hospital were summarized. Relevant literature from January \n1, 2010 to March 31, 2025 was retrieved and reviewed through Wanfang Data, China \nNational Knowledge Infrastructure, and the National Center for Biotechnology \nInformation database. Results: The patient was a 19-year-old male. The clinical \nmanifestations included recurrent fever for 7 years. The peripheral blood \nroutine test showed peripheral blood pancytopenia accompanied by monocytopenia. \nThe serum granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibody was \nnegative. Chest CT revealed diffuse interstitial lung changes, while \n18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG \nPET-CT) demonstrated splenomegaly with multiple focal FDG-avid lesions. Bone \nmarrow biopsy indicated marrow failure. Histopathological examination of lung \nbiopsy specimens was consistent with alveolar proteinosis, whereas \nhistopathology of the spleen biopsy revealed granuloma and patellar necrosis. \nMetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of the splenic specimen detected \nM. kansasii, and genetic testing identified a germline GATA2 mutation(c.1128del, \np.Y377fs). Based on these findings, a diagnosis of GATA2 deficiency with \nsecondary PAP and splenic M. kansasii infection was established. Following \nanti-NTM treatment, the patient's infection was controlled; however, \nhematopoietic stem cell transplantation was planned due to bone marrow failure. \nLiterature search revealed 4 cases of GATA2 deficiency syndrome with bone marrow \ndysplasia. Three cases developed PAP. All 4 cases had NTM infection, including 1 \ncase with disseminated NTM infection in the lungs, spleen, and bone marrow. \nGATA2 deficiency syndrome patients are prone to decreased numbers and functional \ndefects of cells such as monocytes and NK cells, resulting in immune dysfunction \nand pulmonary alveolar macrophage dysfunction, reduced ability to resist NTM, \nleading to the patient being prone to NTM infection, namely MonoMAC syndrome, \nand can cause secondary PAP. Early identification and timely completion of \ngenetic testing are beneficial for clear diagnosis and establishment of precise \nintervention strategies. Conclusion: GATA2 deficiency is a rare autosomal \ndominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the GATA2 gene.

However, genetic \nvariations may influence pathogenicity and drug resistance. This study \ninvestigates mutations in the Rv2660c gene and their potential impact on protein \nstructure and function.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The Rv2660c gene from 40 clinical isolates was analysed \nusing PCR amplification and sequencing. Structural and immunological analyses \nwere conducted using I-TASSER, B-cell epitope prediction tools, T-cell epitope \nprediction, and molecular docking simulations to evaluate the effects of \nmutations on protein structure and immune interactions.\nRESULTS: A T>C mutation at position 139 was identified in one isolate (MDR094R, \nNCBI GenBank Accession PV544294), resulting in a phenylalanine-to-leucine \nsubstitution at position 47 (Phe47Leu). This variation was also found in several \nother strains, M. tuberculosis strain SEA14117P6C4 (CP.041797.1.), M. \ntuberculosis strain 24 (CP136191.1), and M. tuberculosis strain 4 (CP136200.1). \nPhylogenetic analysis showed that proteins with the Phe47Leu mutation formed a \nseparate cluster, indicating a unique evolutionary trajectory. Structural \npredictions indicated minimal changes in the protein structure, with slight \nalterations near the mutation site. Immunological analysis revealed that the \nmutation affected both continuous and discontinuous B-cell epitopes, altering \ntheir conformation and length. T-cell epitope predictions showed reduced binding \naffinity for certain HLA alleles, while some epitopes gained higher affinity. \nDocking studies confirmed minor changes in binding energy and hydrogen bond \ninteractions.\nCONCLUSION: The Phe47Leu mutation in the Rv2660c gene underscores the genetic \ndiversity of M. tuberculosis and may influence antigenicity and immune \nrecognition. These findings highlight the importance of further functional \nvalidation to assess the implications of this variation, particularly in the \ncontext of vaccine design and host-pathogen interactions.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Tuberculosis Association of India.

Alternatively, Lactic acid bacteria \n(LAB) have gained attention for their potential in sustainable agricultural \npractices, benefitting human health and the environment. This study hypothesized \nthat LAB, specifically Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (RBX7), have \nantimicrobial activity against phytopathogens, namely Xoo and Pan. The research \naims to determine the antimicrobial activity of RBX7 and identify the \nantimicrobial compounds likely responsible for disease suppression. The \nantimicrobial cell-free supernatant (CFS) of RBX7 was obtained and tested for \nantimicrobial activity against Xoo and Pan using multiple methods, i.e. agar \nwell diffusion, time-kill assays, detached leaf assays, and visualized using \nscanning electron microscopy (SEM). Metabolomic profiling was conducted to \nidentify potential antimicrobial metabolites using LC-MS/MS-QTOF. Finally, the \nantibacterial effects of LAB were confirmed by in planta experiment. The \ndetached leaf assay showed no lesions following inoculation with RBX7 live \nculture and RBX7 CFS, in line with the results from agar well diffusion assays. \nSEM analysis showed Pan cell rupture and Xoo cell shrinkage when treated with \nRBX7. Metabolomic analysis of RBX7 identified antimicrobial compounds such as \ncefixime, cinchonidine, antimycin A, and bufalin. Finally, in planta assays \nrevealed that both RBX7 CFS and the live culture effectively suppressed BLB \nsymptoms in rice seedlings. This study highlights a safer and more sustainable \napproach for controlling BLB in rice by utilizing RBX7 as a biocontrol agent, \nadvancing efforts toward achieving sustainable development goals in rice \nfarming.\n\n© 2025.

For evaluating the disease-resistance ability of a host \nplant against any pathogen, controlled conditions are a prerequisite that cannot \nbe obtained with soil-based systems. Variation in environmental conditions \nduring challenge inoculation of a pathogen, when performed in fields or a \npolyhouse, may lead to spurious results. This is of particular importance when \ndealing with disease resistance in a fruit tree like pomegranate, as determined \nafter years of research efforts. Due to lack of uniformity and environment \nvariability, the possibility of pathogen escapes and false positives is large \nunder field or polyhouse conditions. To address these limitations, we have used \ntissue-cultured plants and developed an easy, reliable, rapid, and efficient in \nvitro bioassay for bacterial blight on pomegranate. Owing to its performance \nunder a closed system, this system minimizes the risk of pathogen escapes, \nreduces environmental variability, and provides a robust high-throughput \nscreening platform for disease resistance and tissue sampling for downstream \nfunctional genomics studies.

Additionally, resistance evaluation across six strawberry cultivars \nrevealed that 'Yue Xiu' was the most susceptible, followed closely by 'Jiande \nHong', 'Hong Yu', 'Li Fen', and 'Hong Yan', while 'Fen Yu' exhibited the highest \nresistance. Biological characterization showed that strain JD1 grows optimally \nat 25°C and pH 7.0, with significant inhibition observed at 35°C and under \nacidic (pH 4) or alkaline (pH 9) conditions. In bactericide screening, \ntetramycin and benziothiazolinone were identified as highly effective against \nJD, followed by sintracin acetate aqueous with minor efficacy, whereas \nkasugamycin and quinoline copper showed limited or no efficacy. Collectively, \nthese findings not only emphasize the threat posed by\xa0X. fragariae strain JD1 to \nstrawberry production but also provide critical insights that inform integrated \nmanagement strategies, including the use of resistant cultivars, environmental \ncontrols, and targeted bactericides, for controlling ALS.\n\nDOI: 10.1094/PDIS-10-25-2070-RE\nPMID: 41362129"},

Alternatively, Lactic acid bacteria \n(LAB) have gained attention for their potential in sustainable agricultural \npractices, benefitting human health and the environment. This study hypothesized \nthat LAB, specifically Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (RBX7), have \nantimicrobial activity against phytopathogens, namely Xoo and Pan. The research \naims to determine the antimicrobial activity of RBX7 and identify the \nantimicrobial compounds likely responsible for disease suppression. The \nantimicrobial cell-free supernatant (CFS) of RBX7 was obtained and tested for \nantimicrobial activity against Xoo and Pan using multiple methods, i.e. agar \nwell diffusion, time-kill assays, detached leaf assays, and visualized using \nscanning electron microscopy (SEM). Metabolomic profiling was conducted to \nidentify potential antimicrobial metabolites using LC-MS/MS-QTOF. Finally, the \nantibacterial effects of LAB were confirmed by in planta experiment. The \ndetached leaf assay showed no lesions following inoculation with RBX7 live \nculture and RBX7 CFS, in line with the results from agar well diffusion assays. \nSEM analysis showed Pan cell rupture and Xoo cell shrinkage when treated with \nRBX7. Metabolomic analysis of RBX7 identified antimicrobial compounds such as \ncefixime, cinchonidine, antimycin A, and bufalin. Finally, in planta assays \nrevealed that both RBX7 CFS and the live culture effectively suppressed BLB \nsymptoms in rice seedlings. This study highlights a safer and more sustainable \napproach for controlling BLB in rice by utilizing RBX7 as a biocontrol agent, \nadvancing efforts toward achieving sustainable development goals in rice \nfarming.\n\n© 2025.

For evaluating the disease-resistance ability of a host \nplant against any pathogen, controlled conditions are a prerequisite that cannot \nbe obtained with soil-based systems. Variation in environmental conditions \nduring challenge inoculation of a pathogen, when performed in fields or a \npolyhouse, may lead to spurious results. This is of particular importance when \ndealing with disease resistance in a fruit tree like pomegranate, as determined \nafter years of research efforts. Due to lack of uniformity and environment \nvariability, the possibility of pathogen escapes and false positives is large \nunder field or polyhouse conditions. To address these limitations, we have used \ntissue-cultured plants and developed an easy, reliable, rapid, and efficient in \nvitro bioassay for bacterial blight on pomegranate. Owing to its performance \nunder a closed system, this system minimizes the risk of pathogen escapes, \nreduces environmental variability, and provides a robust high-throughput \nscreening platform for disease resistance and tissue sampling for downstream \nfunctional genomics studies. The protocols enable reproducible experiments to \nstudy plant response to bacterial blight infection.

Copper tolerance [≥ \n150 µg/ml of copper sulfate pentahydrate (CSP)] is commonly found in XAP \npopulations, but copper resistance (> 200 µg/ml of CSP) has not been previously \nreported. This study reports and characterizes the first copper-resistant strain \nof XAP (XAPCuR), which was isolated from diseased leaves of Prunus laurocerasus \nin North Carolina in 2017. Whole genome sequence analysis of XAPCuR revealed a \n~247 kb plasmid carrying a duplicated 17 kb cluster containing copper resistance \ncandidate genes copL, copA, copB, copC, copD, copM, copG, copF, cusA and cusB. \nThe two copies of the copper resistance cluster did not increase the level of \ncopper resistance compared to a single copy, but deletion of both copies led to \nthe loss of resistance. Functional analysis of the cluster revealed that copL-D \nis the major contributor to copper resistance, allowing XAP to grow on nutrient \nagar containing up to 750 µg/ml of CSP. Removing copL from copL-D decreased the \nresistance level to 300 µg/ml of CSP. The copF and cusAB genes alone did not \nconfer copper resistance, however, adding copF-cusB to copL-D increased the \nresistance level of XAP to 1000 µg/ml of CSP. The resistance genotype and \nphenotype were able to be transferred from XAP to Xanthomonas perforans via \nconjugation. This plasmid has up to 99% identity to other copper resistance \nplasmids of closely related xanthomonads, indicating horizontal transfer is \ndriving its spread.\n\nDOI: 10.1094/PHYTO-10-25-0338-R\nPMID: 41363119'},

The possibility of orthopoxvirus infection \nand epidemics in humans also exists, including the variola and monkeypox \nviruses. The latter causes mpox and has posed a global risk since 2022. \nAccordingly, there is an increasing need for research and development of \nvaccines and therapeutics for orthopoxviruses, driven by pathological \nunderstanding of their infection mechanism, including vaccinia and animal models \nof orthopoxviral infections. This study introduces methods for establishing \nanimal models of orthopoxvirus-related infections and the pathological \ncharacteristics of these models.\nMETHODS: Establishing animal models of orthopoxvirus infection was based on \ntheir pathological characteristics through reviews of related articles and \nexamples of efficacy evaluations of vaccinia immunoglobulins and therapeutic \nmonoclonal antibodies for the treatment of vaccinia virus infection using animal \nmodels of orthopoxvirus infections.\nRESULTS: Animal models of orthopoxvirus infection show various pathological \naspects depending on the immune status and infection route, having been used in \nnonclinical trials or animal experiments to evaluate the efficacy of smallpox \nvaccines and therapeutic candidates. Monoclonal antibodies show potential to \nreplace existing vaccinia immunoglobulins.\nCONCLUSIONS: Animal models of orthopoxvirus-associated infection can improve our \npathological understanding of orthopoxviral infections and be used to evaluate \nthe efficacy of candidates in the development of vaccines and therapeutics for \nsmallpox and orthopoxvirus-associated infections.\n\n목적: 두창 바이러스의 생물테러 악용 가능성과 재출현에 대한 우려는 여전히 존재하며, 2022년 이후 전 세계적으로 발생 중인 엠폭스의 경우처럼 \n두창 바이러스가 속한 올소폭스바이러스의 사람 감염과 유행의 가능성도 있다. 이에 따라 두창 및 엠폭스와 같은 올소폭스바이러스에 대한 백신과 \n치료제의 연구와 개발의 필요성이 증가하고 있다. 본 연구에서는 두창 백신의 주요 성분인 백시니아 바이러스에 대한 실험동물 모델 구축의 필요성을 \n고찰하고, 백시니아 면역글로불린 및 단클론항체의 효능평가 사례 소개를 통해 향후 백신 및 치료제 개발에 이들 동물모델의 활용 가능성을 제시하고자 \n한다.\n방법: 올소폭스바이러스 감염 연구에 사용되는 주요 실험동물 모델의 구축 방법과 병리학적 특징을 문헌조사를 통해 소개하였다. 또한 올소폭스바이러스 \n감염 실험동물 모델을 이용하여 백시니아 면역글로불린과 이를 대체하기 위해 개발 중인 단클론항체의 효능평가 사례를 소개하였다.\n결과: 올소폭스바이러스 감염 동물 모델은 면역 상태, 감염경로 등에 따라 다양한 병리 양상을 보이며, 실제 두창 백신 및 치료제 후보물질의 \n비임상 시험에서 유용하게 활용되고 있다. 특히 단클론항체는 기존의 백시니아 면역글로불린을 대체할 수 있는 가능성을 보여주고 있다.\n결론: 올소폭스바이러스 실험동물 모델은 두창 및 올소폭스바이러스의 감염에 대한 예방 백신이나 치료제의 개발에 있어 병리학적 이해와 후보물질의 \n비임상 효능평가를 위해 유용하게 활용될 수 있다.\n\nCopyright © Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency.\n\nDOI: 10.56786/PHWR.2025.18.42.1\nPMCID: PMC12576260\nPMID: 41333834\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of Interest: The authors have no \nconflicts of interest to declare.'}],

The traditional plaque purification process to screen out a \nvaccine strain with genetically consistent stability from a mixed pool of viral \nclones generally requires laborsome work. We utilized live-cell imaging \ntechnique enabling us to isolate monoclonal vaccine strains to simplify and \nimprove the efficiency of this process. Here, we genetically engineered the \nvaccinia virus TianTan (VTT) using CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate recombinant \nVTT viruses (VTT-WS01-EGFP) that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein \n(EGFP). Initially, we performed 9 rounds of plaque purification using \ntraditional plaque assay, yielding 50 candidate clones. The Incucyte Live-Cell \nImaging and Analysis system was subsequently performed to conduct a rigorous, \nhigh-resolution screening of these candidates in a more automated, sensitive and \nhigh-throughput way. Through this screening process, we ultimately obtained 31 \npure viral clones that were free of parental strain contamination, followed by \nthe analysis of plaque formation, fluorescent plaque size, and plaque \nmorphology, and 11 candidate clones were selected for immunological evaluation. \nFurthermore, we found that clone 49 induced a relatively high titer of anti-VTT \nneutralizing antibodies and elicited the production of cross-reactive IgG \nagainst monkeypox virus antigens, thereby validating its potential as a \ncandidate strain as a monkeypox virus vaccine. Taken together, our data \ndemonstrates that live-cell imaging technique significantly accelerates the \nscreening process for the isolation of monoclonal viral clones as recombinant \nviral vaccines, and holds considerable potential in attenuated strain selection \nas well as investigations into biological characteristics of viruses, including \nviral replication.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Current diagnostics, \nrelying on centralized laboratory testing, require specialized personnel and \nequipment. We aimed to develop a point-of-care testing (POCT) kit that \nsimplifies nucleic acid extraction, minimizes contamination, and enables \nimmediate, accurate MPXV detection.\nMETHODS: We introduced a novel MPXV POCT kit, featuring a separate MPXV DNA \nrapid release step and a closed integrated device combining recombinase \npolymerase amplification (RPA) and lateral flow assay (LFA). A fluorescent RPA \nassay identified F3L-targeting primers and probes with superior amplification \nefficiency. The RPA system was coupled with LFA to assess the visual diagnostic \nperformance, and then integrated into a POCT device, complemented by a nucleic \nacid release agent to form the kit. The kit's specificity, sensitivity, and \ndiagnostic performance were validated through clinical body fluid samples.\nRESULTS: Our nucleic acid release agent streamlines sample processing without \ncompromising detection accuracy, eliminating the need for traditional nucleic \nacid extraction. The RPA reaction system was formulated into freeze-dried \nmicrospheres and integrated directly into the reaction chamber of the POCT \ndevice, ensuring the stability and shelf-life of the reagents and simplifying \nthe preparation and configuration process. The POCT device's enclosed design \neradicates transfer steps, significantly reducing RPA-induced aerosol \ncontamination. Results can be visually interpreted within 25\xa0min, a substantial \nimprovement over existing methods. In clinical sample validation, the POCT kit \nshowed high specificity and sensitivity, distinguishing other pathogens, with \n100% consistency with RT-qPCR results in detecting mpox patient samples. \nCompared to RT-qPCR and ddPCR, our POCT kit demonstrates stronger diagnostic \nperformance, with the lowest positive concentration we detected being 41 \ncopies/mL (2.1 copies/reaction) in clinical samples and 2.5 copies/μL (2.5 \ncopies/reaction) of DNA plasmid standards, significantly increasing the \ndetection rate of mpox.\nCONCLUSIONS: This compact, portable POCT kit, requiring no professional \noperation or precision instruments, offers a promising solution for on-site and \nhome self-testing. Its high sensitivity and specificity, coupled with the \ncapacity to swiftly adapt to new MPXV strains, positions it as an effective tool \nfor early detection, vital for controlling mpox outbreaks.\n\n© 2025.

With no \nclinically validated treatment for MPXV infections, it is important to develop a \nbroad-range vaccine that is effective against this disease. This study aimed to \ndesign novel multiple-epitope DNA and mRNA vaccines against MXPV using \ncomprehensive immunoinformatics and reverse vaccinology techniques. Eleven MPXV \nproteins were selected from the UniProt database and assessed for their \nantigenicity and allergenicity. Proteins exhibiting significant antigenicity and \nnon-allergenic characteristics were examined for the prediction of T-cell and \nB-cell epitopes. Four MHC-I, eight MHC-II, and six B-cell epitopes were coupled \nwith specific linkers and adjuvant peptide sequences to boost the immunological \nresponse to the developed vaccine. The designed vaccines showed antigenic nature \nwith a 0.5936 score and solubility nature with a 0.513 score, and its GRAVY \nscore of 0.147 indicates their hydrophilic nature. Structural validation \nconfirmed the superior tertiary structure of the designed vaccines. Molecular \ndocking studies demonstrated a robust interaction between human TLR-8 and the \ndeveloped vaccines, with a docking score of -1208.2\xa0kcal/mol, and Moleculae \nDynamics (MD) simulations confirmed its stability. The immune simulation results \nindicated that vaccination strongly stimulated immunity, resulting in high \nconcentrations of IgG and IgM antibodies. Cloning analysis and in silico \nrestriction prediction demonstrated the viability of integrating the developed \nvaccine into an Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system. Furthermore, an \nmRNA vaccine was developed by incorporating a 5' cap, 5' untranslated region \n(UTR), Kozak sequence, and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with the CD40 \nligand (CD40L) linked to the selected epitopes using EAAAK linkers. A poly (A) \ntail, MITD1, and 3' UTR were appended to the 3' end of the construct. The mRNA \nvaccine design incorporated codon optimization, resulting in a CAI score 0.83 \nand GC content of 60.46%, indicating efficient vaccine expression within host \ncells. Analysis of several parameters revealed that the architecture of the \nsynthesized mRNA was stable with MFE: -2170.70\xa0kcal/mol. These outcomes may \ncontribute to the development of an experimental MPXV vaccine with stronger \npotency and superior safety measures. Additional in vitro and in vivo \nexperiments are required to test the safety and efficacy of these newly \ndeveloped vaccines.\n\n© 2025.

This \ngeographical expansion introduces a potential risk of transmission in Zambia, \nwhere geographic proximity and active trade routes increase vulnerability. We \nreport the first confirmed case of Mpox in Zambia, involving a 32-year-old \nTanzanian cross-border truck driver who presented to Mukando Health Post in \nCentral Province, on 4 October 2024.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We present a 32-year-old male patient of African descent \nwhose symptoms included a history of 3-day fever, itchy rash, joint pains, \nfatigue, and sore throat. Physical examination revealed a papular rash over the \nface, trunk, and extremities with extension to the palms but spared the soles of \nthe feet. No lesions were noted in either the mucosal or genital areas. However, \nenlarged lymph nodes were palpable in the cervical region. Biological specimens \nwere collected and submitted to Zambia National Public Health Reference \nLaboratory. Samples collected, including oral swabs in transport media, whole \nblood, skin scrapping from lesions, swabs from lesions, and urine samples. \nAnalytics conducted on the samples included testing for polymerase chain \nreaction for Mpox, human immunodeficiency virus, rapid plasma reagin for \nsyphilis, and hepatitis B and C. Contact tracing identified both primary and \nsecondary contacts. Polymerase chain reaction confirmed Mpox DNA in initial \nwhole blood, with persistent detection in skin lesions and throat swabs. The \npatient was commenced on symptomatic treatment with benzyl benzoate, \nparacetamol, ibuprofen, chlorpheniramine, and phenoxymethylpenicillin and \ncontinued the same treatment after the confirmation of Mpox diagnosis. He was \nadvised to continue good hygiene practice and remain in isolation to prevent \ntransmission to others. None of the 22 traced contacts reported any symptoms nor \ntested positive.\nCONCLUSION: Our report emphasizes the transmission risk for Mpox in \ntraditionally nonendemic areas resulting from cross-border movement. This \nhighlights the need for countries to strengthen surveillance systems resulting \nin increased sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness required for early \ndetection and response to Mpox. A multifaceted collaborative approach is \nrequired between countries to ensure formalized cross-border collaboration, \nstrengthening health-seeking behavior through deployment of mobile clinics, and \nutilization of digital platforms risk communication and community engagement. \nImproved supply chain management for laboratory reagents, sample collection, and \npersonal protective equipment coupled with training of health workers is crucial \nfor adequate preparedness and successful containment of outbreaks. These \ninitiatives, collectively undertaken, will result in a robust response system \nsafeguarding public health and preventing emerging threats such as Mpox from \nbecoming endemic.\n\n© 2025.

With no \nclinically validated treatment for MPXV infections, it is important to develop a \nbroad-range vaccine that is effective against this disease. This study aimed to \ndesign novel multiple-epitope DNA and mRNA vaccines against MXPV using \ncomprehensive immunoinformatics and reverse vaccinology techniques. Eleven MPXV \nproteins were selected from the UniProt database and assessed for their \nantigenicity and allergenicity. Proteins exhibiting significant antigenicity and \nnon-allergenic characteristics were examined for the prediction of T-cell and \nB-cell epitopes. Four MHC-I, eight MHC-II, and six B-cell epitopes were coupled \nwith specific linkers and adjuvant peptide sequences to boost the immunological \nresponse to the developed vaccine. The designed vaccines showed antigenic nature \nwith a 0.5936 score and solubility nature with a 0.513 score, and its GRAVY \nscore of 0.147 indicates their hydrophilic nature. Structural validation \nconfirmed the superior tertiary structure of the designed vaccines. Molecular \ndocking studies demonstrated a robust interaction between human TLR-8 and the \ndeveloped vaccines, with a docking score of -1208.2\xa0kcal/mol, and Moleculae \nDynamics (MD) simulations confirmed its stability. The immune simulation results \nindicated that vaccination strongly stimulated immunity, resulting in high \nconcentrations of IgG and IgM antibodies. Cloning analysis and in silico \nrestriction prediction demonstrated the viability of integrating the developed \nvaccine into an Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system. Furthermore, an \nmRNA vaccine was developed by incorporating a 5' cap, 5' untranslated region \n(UTR), Kozak sequence, and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with the CD40 \nligand (CD40L) linked to the selected epitopes using EAAAK linkers. A poly (A) \ntail, MITD1, and 3' UTR were appended to the 3' end of the construct. The mRNA \nvaccine design incorporated codon optimization, resulting in a CAI score 0.83 \nand GC content of 60.46%, indicating efficient vaccine expression within host \ncells. Analysis of several parameters revealed that the architecture of the \nsynthesized mRNA was stable with MFE: -2170.70\xa0kcal/mol. These outcomes may \ncontribute to the development of an experimental MPXV vaccine with stronger \npotency and superior safety measures. Additional in vitro and in vivo \nexperiments are required to test the safety and efficacy of these newly \ndeveloped vaccines.\n\n© 2025.

However, the infection profile of MPXV in testicular \ntissue-associated cells and the host immune response remain poorly understood. \nThis study investigated the susceptibility of Sertoli cells, which serve as the \nstructural and functional core unit of seminiferous tubules in the testis, to \nMPXV, and the host gene expression profiles were analyzed. Following MPXV \ninoculation of Sertoli cells, viral load detection, transmission electron \nmicroscopy, and transcriptomic sequencing revealed that MPXV induces lesions in \nSertoli cells, accompanied by viral replication. The virus assembles and \nreplicates by forming viral factories within the cytoplasm, ultimately releasing \nenveloped viral particles via exocytosis. Upon infection, genes involved in \nstress response, inflammation pathways, and cell cycle regulation are \nupregulated. Additionally, genes associated with olfactory transduction pathways \nare activated, while antiviral genes are suppressed, and virus-related genes \nlinked to interferon receptors are highly expressed. This study demonstrates \nthat MPXV infects human Sertoli cells and defines the accompanying host-response \nlandscape, offering cell-level mechanistic clues that may be relevant to the \nrare occurrence of epididymo-orchitis in severe MPXV cases and guiding \nhypothesis-driven in-vivo validation.\n\n© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/jmv.70661\nPMID: 41181874 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'},

In this \nstudy, we report a newly discovered TYK2 deficiency patient with recurrent \npulmonary infections. The patient, a 27-year-old Chinese man with a history of \ntuberculosis, presented with recurrent cough, phlegm, and purulent sputum. Lung \nCT scan showed bronchiectasis with concomitant infection. Next-generation \nsequencing (NGS) identified Mycobacterium gordonae and Mycobacterium chelonae in \nlung, along with heterozygous c.997G>A&c.10C>T (p.V333M&p.R4C) mutation in TYK2. \nFurther pathogenicity prediction analysis via dbNSFP (v5.1a) suggested the \npotential pathogenicity of this genetic variant. Additionally, TYK2 mRNA \nexpression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) also decreased \nsignificantly.

It is therefore important to know \ntheir population status, the diseases to which these animals are exposed, and \nhow they affect their repopulation. In this sense, this study aims to study how \nthe presence of mycobacteria affects the lynx population in Extremadura \n(southwest of Spain). To this end, blood samples, tracheal swabs, and \ntracheobronchial washings from live-captured lynxes, as well as mediastinal and \nmesenteric lymph nodes from roadkill animals, were collected. The association \nbetween the presence of mycobacteria and various factors-including body \ncondition, age, sex, and blood parameters-was subsequently evaluated. Up to \ndate, our findings show the absence of tuberculosis (TB) in all lynxes tested, \nwhile they seem to be reservoirs of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), mainly \nM. lentiflavum, the most isolated species. Nonetheless, these mycobacteria \nappear to have no significant effect on the health condition of the animals.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/vetsci12060527\nPMCID: PMC12197730\nPMID: 40559764\n\nConflict of interest statement: Author Beatriz Serrano was employed by the \ncompany Life Lynxconnect Project, FOTEX S.L.

NTM (e.g., Mycobacterium chimaera, \nMycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium chelonae, etc.) are waterborne pathogens \ncommonly found in building water systems, where they pose a primary concern for \nvulnerable patient populations and can cause severe disease. NTM can also be \nrecovered from various engineered environments, including aerosols from pools \nand spas, ice machines, and medical devices in healthcare settings, such as HCUs \nused during cardiac surgery. Due to the diverse bacterial communities that exist \nin environmental samples, isolating and recovering NTM from water using \nculture-based methods is an arduous process. Decontamination agents, although \noften successful in reducing non-mycobacterial growth, have shown limited \neffectiveness in recovering some NTM species, while also killing others. To \naddress this issue, a more selective agar known as NTM ELITE agar has been \ndeveloped. This highly selective medium includes four antimicrobial agents \n(colistin, fosfomycin, amphotericin, and C-390) and does not require a \ndecontamination step. In this data article, we present images of colonies grown \non the Elite agar that have been confirmed as NTM, captured using an iPhone 11 \ndual camera. The dataset contains high-quality images of NTM colonies (top views \nof agar plates) at different growth stages. To our knowledge, this is the first \nopen-access dataset of NTM images, which can help fill the gaps in images of \nenvironmental NTM grown on the new ELITE agar. It is also valuable for \nmicrobiologists, who can recognize mycobacteria of human origin but may have \nlimited experience in identifying NTM present in environmental samples.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.dib.2025.111358\nPMCID: PMC11876747\nPMID: 40041481"},

Luigi \nHospital, Orbassano, Italy.\n\nBACKGROUND: Worldwide, the detection of Mycobacterium chimaera in LivaNova \nheater-cooler units (HCUs) has led to their replacement with other HCUs, \nalthough non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) have been reported also for HCUs \nproduced by other manufacturers. In almost all hospitals of our region, LivaNova \nHCUs have been replaced with Maquet HCU40s, regularly disinfected with \nchloramine-T.\nAIM: To report the results of the surveillance over a 63-month operation period \nof the Maquet devices, and to provide a trend in NTM positivity over time.\nMETHODS: Twenty-nine Maquet devices (HCU40 and HU35) were monitored by two \nculture methods and propidium monoazide polymerase chain reaction (PMA-PCR) \nmethod. The trend in NTM positivity rate was evaluated through the Locally \nEstimated Scatterplot Smoothing regression and then modelled over time through \nsegmented logistic regression.\nFINDINGS: The data acquired during the study period demonstrate a remarkable \nincrease in the positivity rate, especially after the third year (maximum slope \nchange at 1280 days). Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were isolated in 150 water \nsamples (37.2%); 100% and 62% of HCU40 and HU35 devices, respectively, were \ncolonized with non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The most frequently detected \nspecies were Mycobacterium gordonae (73%) followed by Mycobacterium chelonae \n(41%) and Mycobacterium paragordonae (11%).\nCONCLUSION: Preventive strategies by disinfection with chloramine-T did not \neffectively reduce non-tuberculous mycobacteria colonization of Maquet devices. \nAlthough, to date, no cases of postoperative invasive infections linked to \nMaquet devices have been reported, our microbiological results emphasize the \nneed for (1) designing changes to increase safety of devices and (2) researching \nand developing new disinfection protocols including alternative molecules.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Healthcare Infection Society.

In this study, we aimed to determine the incidence of NTM isolates and \nnontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) in five closely located \nhospitals in an area of northern Spain and analyse differences between them.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Demographic, microbiological, clinical and radiological \ndata were collected retrospectively from all patients with a NTM isolated from \nrespiratory specimens at five hospitals between 2012 and 2019. Mycobacterium \ngordonae isolates were excluded. Once the data was collected, it was determined \nwhich patients met the NMT-PD criteria.\nRESULTS: 594 patients were included in the study. The mean incidence rate of NTM \nisolates across all five hospitals in the period studied was 4.15 per 100,000 \nperson-year, while the rate of NTM-PD was 1.2. The annual number of isolates \nshowed an upward trend over this period, but the same did not occur in the \nnumber of cases of NTM-PD. The species most frequently isolated were \nMycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium xenopi and those most \nfrequently causing disease were MAC and Mycobacterium kansassi. There were \nsignificant differences between the five centres.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results are in line with similar studies in Europe in terms of \nNTM isolation and NTM-PD incidence and species isolated; however, we do not see \nthe upward trend in NTM-PD rates described elsewhere. The great variability in \nisolation and disease rates, as well as in species isolated in geographically \nclose areas, underlines, in our opinion, the importance of local environmental \nfactors.\n\nPublisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: La epidemiología de las micobacterias no tuberculosas \n(MNT) no se conoce bien.

Patients carry TYK2 gene mutations and suffer from recurrent infections \nby intracellular pathogens, including mycobacteria. Delayed diagnosis often \nhinders timely and effective treatment, resulting in poor prognosis. In this \nstudy, we report a newly discovered TYK2 deficiency patient with recurrent \npulmonary infections. The patient, a 27-year-old Chinese man with a history of \ntuberculosis, presented with recurrent cough, phlegm, and purulent sputum. Lung \nCT scan showed bronchiectasis with concomitant infection. Next-generation \nsequencing (NGS) identified Mycobacterium gordonae and Mycobacterium chelonae in \nlung, along with heterozygous c.997G>A&c.10C>T (p.V333M&p.R4C) mutation in TYK2. \nFurther pathogenicity prediction analysis via dbNSFP (v5.1a) suggested the \npotential pathogenicity of this genetic variant. Additionally, TYK2 mRNA \nexpression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) also decreased \nsignificantly. Following anti-infective treatment, the patient improved and was \ndischarged with regular human immunoglobulin infusion. However, the patient \nunfortunately succumbed to disease exacerbation in October 2021, 15\u2009months after \ndiagnosis. Furthermore, a literature review was conducted on cases of TYK2 \ndeficiency. Previous studies have identified 24 mutation sites within TYK2 gene, \nwhich impair immune function and lead to early-onset recurrent infections. These \nmutations contribute to clinical heterogeneity, with the most common \nmanifestation being recurrent infections by opportunistic pathogens, \nparticularly mycobacteria. Our discovery of a novel TYK2 mutation expands the \ngene's mutation spectrum.

Compared to the reference method, the FluoroType \nMycobacteria assay provided correct species identification in 89.9% of cases \n(107/119). Among the most frequently encountered species in clinical settings, \nlow concordance was obtained for Mycobacterium intracellulare (82.4%, 14/17), \nMycobacterium gordonae (66.7%, 6/9), and Mycobacterium xenopi (75%, 6/8). \nMisidentification was obtained in two cases (Mycobacterium smegmatis instead of \nMycobacterium mageritense, and Mycobacterium mucogenicum instead of \nMycobacterium phocaicum). Using the MBT Mycobacteria assay, 78.1% (93/119) of \nNTM isolates were correctly identified at the species level. One Mycobacterium \neuropaeum isolate was misidentified as M. intracellulare/Mycobacterium chimaera. \nIn five cases, the assay provided more accurate NTM identification compared to \nGenoType assays, in which closely related species are identified as a group. The \nFluoroType Mycobacteria VER 1.0 and the MBT Mycobacteria assays are useful tools \nfor NTM identification from positive cultures, reducing handling time compared \nto GenoType assays. Their routine use in laboratories must take into \nconsideration their performance and limitations in clinical settings.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/jcm.01206-24\nPMCID: PMC11784439\nPMID: 39660810 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'}]},

In this context, soil and root microorganisms may \nplay a role in suppressing the disease. This study investigated the impact of P. \nbrassicae infection on the microbial communities of soil, seeds, roots, and the \nrhizosphere in susceptible and resistant canola lines, with the aim of analyzing \nhost-pathogen-microbiome interactions and identifying microbial taxa potentially \nassociated with disease resistance. Our findings showed that resistant canola \nlines inoculated with P. brassicae (pathotype 3A) exhibited reduced disease \nseverity compared to their susceptible counterparts. Diversity analyses of \nmicrobial communities revealed that clubroot-resistant canola lines tended to \nmaintain more stable and diverse fungal communities, with a higher Shannon index \nthan susceptible lines. Inoculation with P. brassicae induced more pronounced \nchanges in the root microbiome than in the rhizosphere. Additionally, the seed \nmicrobiomes of resistant and susceptible lines displayed distinct bacterial and \nfungal profiles, suggesting that clubroot susceptibility may influence \nseed-associated microbial community composition. Differential abundance analysis \nof root and rhizosphere microbiomes indicated that certain microbial taxa, \nincluding bacterial genera such as Acidovorax, Bacillus, Cupriavidus, Cytophaga, \nDuganella, Flavobacterium, Fluviicola, Luteimonas, Methylotenera, Pedobacter, \nand Peredibacter, as well as fungal genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, \nFusicolla, Paecilomyces, and Rhizophlyctis, may be recruited or enriched in \nresistant canola lines following P. brassicae inoculation, potentially \ncontributing to reduced clubroot severity.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/pathogens14090904\nPMCID: PMC12472839\nPMID: 41011804 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest. \nThe funders had no role in the design of the study; in the collection, analyses, \nor interpretation of data; in the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision \nto publish the results.'},

This study aims to characterize the skin microbiome \ncommunities of young wrestlers and kickboxers in comparison with their \nnon-athlete age-peers.\nMETHODS: A total of 56 combat sport athletes (30 males and 26 females, mean age \n± SD = 18.2 ± 1.5 years) and 25 non-athlete youths (control group: 13 males and \n12 females, mean age ± SD = 19.8 ± 1.2 years) voluntarily consented to \nparticipate in the study conducted by our research team in 2023 and 2024. The \nskin microbiome analysis involved standardized sampling, DNA isolation, \nmolecular sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis, thus enabling detailed \ncharacterization and comparison of the skin microbial community in contact \nsports athletes and the control group.\nRESULTS: Our results revealed notable sexual dimorphism in the skin microbiome \ncomposition of youth. Males showed a higher relative abundance of bacterial \ngenera associated with nosocomial infections and respiratory diseases, while \nfemales had more skin inflammation- and infection-related genera (relative \nabundances in males vs. in females: Corynebacterium-12.0 vs. 7.2; \nLuteimonas-4.4. vs. 1.4; Paracoccus-8.8 vs. 5.0; Psychrobacter-6.3 vs. 4.4; \nCutibacterium-6.4 vs. 11.4; Kocuria-1.6 vs. 3.9; Micrococcus-5.8 vs. 8.5; \nPseudomonas-1.2 vs. 3.4; Streptococcus 3.3 vs. 6.2). We also found skin \nmicrobiome differences between athletes and non-athletes in both sexes: \nwrestlers, who experience frequent skin-to-skin contact and wear less covering \nsportswear, had microbiome profiles distinct from both kickboxers and \nnon-athletes (relative abundances in athletes vs. in non-athletes: \nPsychrobacter-7.3 vs. 0.4; Staphylococcus 9.5 vs. 18.5; predominance of genera \nby sports type: relative abundance of Cutibacterium and Streptococcus was higher \nin kickboxers, and relative abundance of Acinetobacter, Enhydrobacter, \nMicrococcus, and Enhydrobacter was higher in wrestlers). Bacteria linked to skin \ninfections (e.g., Aliterella, Arthrobacter, and Empedobacter) were present in \naround 30% of wrestlers and kickboxers but were absent in the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the heightened risk of skin infections in \ncontact sports and highlight the importance of regular microbiome monitoring and \nhygiene protocols among young athletes.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/sports13090288\nPMCID: PMC12473315\nPMID: 41003594\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing \ninterests.'},

Topical application of fluoride-varnish was weekly administered \nfor one month to all subjects. Clinical indicators and anthropological data, \nsuch as the caries index (DMFT and dmft), were documented for every participant \nat baseline. A baseline assessment and a month after the fluoride varnish \ntreatment were conducted for the salivary pH level and the \nPatient-Hygiene-Performance (PHP) index. Following application of the fluoride \nvarnish, plaque samples were obtained both one month later and before (baseline) \nand were then used for 16S rRNA gene-based Next Generation Sequencing.\nRESULTS: The results showed significant differences in the community composition \nstructure (p\xa0<\xa00.01). Notable caries-associated pathogens in the dental plaque \nmicrobiome were depleted whilst health associated phylum Proteobacteria was \nincreased in the abundance following fluoride-varnish application. In children \nwith mixed dentition, this study found that after one month of fluoride-varnish \ntreatment, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of the dominant \npathogenic genera, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Capnocytophaga, Neisseria, and \nLeptrotrichia, along with an increase in certain genera related to healthy oral \ncondition, mostly from the phylum Proteobacteria, such as Areinmonas, \nPseudoxanthomonas, and Luteimonas.\nCONCLUSIONS: Fluoride-varnish application may shift the community level \nmicroecology from dysbiosis to eubiosis. Moreover, application of \nfluoride-varnish with weekly intervals for one month reduced the caries-causing \nbacteria while enriching the rise of unique, ubiquitous genera primarily \nbelonging to the Proteobacteria, which may plaque a defensive role against \nprogression of caries. Furthermore, a rising pH level towards neutrality (pH 7) \nindicated a healthier oral environment following the application of fluoride \nvarnish.\n\n© 2024 THE AUTHORS.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.sdentj.2024.07.010\nPMCID: PMC11544270\nPMID: 39525937'},

In this study, microbial aerosolization behavior \nand potential pathogenicity during the landfill mining process were \nsystematically investigated. The highest concentration of bacterial aerosols was \nmeasured in the refuse mining area, with a value of 5968\xa0±\xa01608 CFU/m3, while \nthe highest concentration of fungal aerosols was 1196\xa0±\xa0370 CFU/m3 in the refuse \nscreening area. The bacterial and fungal aerosols were distributed primarily in \nthe particle size ranges of 4.7-7.0\xa0µm and >\xa07.0\xa0µm, respectively. The \npathogenic microbes Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Arthrobotrys and Aspergillus had \nhigh bioaerosol aerosolization capacities, with aerosolization indices of \n100-329, 31-62, 2-14 and 1-11, respectively, when released from mineralized \nrefuse. There are more than 100 types of pathogenic bacteria in bioaerosols. The \nmicroorganisms Lysobacter, Luteimonas and Mycolicibacterium, which carry \nvirulence factor genes (VFGs) (pilG, Rv0440, pilT, etc.), can spread VFGs, \naggravate bioaerosol pollution, and threaten the health of workers and nearby \nresidents. This research will help further the understanding of bioaerosol \ncontamination behaviors and potential pathogenicity risks from landfill mining \nactivities.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

The \nabsolute abundances of 101 ARGs of six categories ranged from 105 to 1014 \ncopies/g during the composting process. The tetracyclines, macrolides and \nβ-lactams ARGs were effectively reduced by the maturation phase. Among them, the \nβ-lactam ARGs had the highest abatement efficiency (73-89\u202f%). Quinolones, \naminoglycosides and sulfonamides ARGs had relatively high residues during the \nmaturation phase. Composting treatments with higher C/N (25:1 and 35:1) \nexhibited superior performance in ARGs reduction. Metagenomic analysis revealed \nthe compost microbial community succession from Firmicutes to Proteobacteria and \nActinobacteria. Luteimonas may be potential hosts for high-residual ARGs in \ncompost, while Acinetobacter exhibited strong associations with β-lactam and \nmacrolide ARGs that can be easily reduced. The ARGs in the fertilized soil \nincreased significantly. ARGs such as floR, tetG-01, sul1 and sul2 have the \nhighest abundance in the soil where lettuce is grown. The ARGs reduction is \nbetter in C/N 25:1 group, and the ARGs abundance of the soil is lower after \nfertilization with compost products. The sulfonamide sul1 and sul2 genes have \nalways maintained a high abundance in compost, soil and lettuce. This study \nprovides a theoretical basis for controlling the residue and spread of ARGs by \nregulating the C/N of compost to drive changes in microbial community.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

While C.neoformans infection predominantly occurs in immunocompromised \nindividuals, there has been a significant increase in reports among \nimmunocompetent hosts in recent years. Although the lungs and central nervous \nsystem constitute the most common sites of infection, cryptococcal osteomyelitis \nremains exceptionally rare and is typically associated with disseminated disease \nin immunodeficient patients. Herein, we present a rare case of isolated tibial \ncryptococcal osteomyelitis in an immunocompetent patient.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 64-year-old female who presented with \npain, swelling, and increased local skin temperature in the left lower limb for \none month without any obvious cause. The patient was initially diagnosed with \nosteomyelitis at a local county hospital and underwent surgical treatment. Due \nto poor postoperative healing, she was referred to our hospital for surgical \ndebridement. Preoperative wound specimen culture revealed Luteimonas deserti. \nSimultaneously, intraoperative tissue samples were taken from the patient for \ntargeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) testing, which revealed the presence \nof C. neoformans. While the culture was negative, the C. neoformans capsular \nantigen test was positive. The patient had normal immune function and no \nunderlying diseases. Ultimately, the patient was treated with fluconazole and \nsurgery, resulting in a good prognosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: we report a case of tibial osteomyelitis caused by Cryptococcus \nneoformans in an immunocompetent patient, with diagnosis confirmed through \ntargeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) and serum Cryptococcal capsular \nantigen testingOur results demonstrate the great potential of tNGS in the \ndetection of infectious pathogens. In patients with negative culture results, \ntNGS can quickly detect various pathogens, providing accurate diagnosis and \nfacilitating appropriate treatment for patients.\n\n© 2025.

This study aims to characterize the skin microbiome \ncommunities of young wrestlers and kickboxers in comparison with their \nnon-athlete age-peers.\nMETHODS: A total of 56 combat sport athletes (30 males and 26 females, mean age \n± SD = 18.2 ± 1.5 years) and 25 non-athlete youths (control group: 13 males and \n12 females, mean age ± SD = 19.8 ± 1.2 years) voluntarily consented to \nparticipate in the study conducted by our research team in 2023 and 2024. The \nskin microbiome analysis involved standardized sampling, DNA isolation, \nmolecular sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis, thus enabling detailed \ncharacterization and comparison of the skin microbial community in contact \nsports athletes and the control group.\nRESULTS: Our results revealed notable sexual dimorphism in the skin microbiome \ncomposition of youth. Males showed a higher relative abundance of bacterial \ngenera associated with nosocomial infections and respiratory diseases, while \nfemales had more skin inflammation- and infection-related genera (relative \nabundances in males vs. in females: Corynebacterium-12.0 vs. 7.2; \nLuteimonas-4.4. vs. 1.4; Paracoccus-8.8 vs. 5.0; Psychrobacter-6.3 vs. 4.4; \nCutibacterium-6.4 vs. 11.4; Kocuria-1.6 vs. 3.9; Micrococcus-5.8 vs. 8.5; \nPseudomonas-1.2 vs. 3.4; Streptococcus 3.3 vs. 6.2). We also found skin \nmicrobiome differences between athletes and non-athletes in both sexes: \nwrestlers, who experience frequent skin-to-skin contact and wear less covering \nsportswear, had microbiome profiles distinct from both kickboxers and \nnon-athletes (relative abundances in athletes vs. in non-athletes: \nPsychrobacter-7.3 vs. 0.4; Staphylococcus 9.5 vs. 18.5; predominance of genera \nby sports type: relative abundance of Cutibacterium and Streptococcus was higher \nin kickboxers, and relative abundance of Acinetobacter, Enhydrobacter, \nMicrococcus, and Enhydrobacter was higher in wrestlers). Bacteria linked to skin \ninfections (e.g., Aliterella, Arthrobacter, and Empedobacter) were present in \naround 30% of wrestlers and kickboxers but were absent in the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the heightened risk of skin infections in \ncontact sports and highlight the importance of regular microbiome monitoring and \nhygiene protocols among young athletes.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/sports13090288\nPMCID: PMC12473315\nPMID: 41003594\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing \ninterests.'},

However, the biogeochemical \ninteractions among plants, microbes, and soil that mobilize P remain largely \nunknown in intercropping systems. Pot experiments with maize-soybean \nintercropping in a calcareous soil were conducted to investigate the potential \nchemical and biological transformation mechanisms of inorganic P (Pi) and \norganic P (Po) using sequential extraction and Illumina MiSeq sequencing. \nCompared to monocropping of each crop, maize-soybean intercropping significantly \nenhanced total P uptake of the two crops by mobilizing Ca2-Pi [extracted by \nbicarbonate (NaHCO3)], Al-Pi/Po [extracted by ammonium fluoride (NH4F)] and \nFe-Pi [extracted by sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate (NaOH-Na2CO3)] \nfractions.

In \ncontrast, compared to monocroppping, no significant change in the soil pH was \nobserved under maize-soybean intercropping. Therefore, the enhanced P uptake of \nthe maize-soybean intercropping probably resulted from a synergistic effect of \nrhizosphere organic carbon deposit, increased activities of ALP and PDE, \ntogether with the bacteria (Microvirga, Lysobacter, Microlunatus and \nSphingomonas) which showed correlation with soil P forms, while the generally \nrecognized rhizosphere acidification was excluded in this investigated \ncalcareous soil. Moreover, the selected bacterial genera exhibited a closer \nnetwork in the rhizosphere of soybean compared to maize, suggesting enhanced \ninteractions among bacteria in the soybean rhizosphere.

Indoor microbial composition is \nassociated with SBS symptoms, but the impact of microbial functional genes and \npotential metabolic products has not been characterized. We conducted a shotgun \nmicrobial metagenomic sequencing for vacuum dust collected in urban and rural \nschools in Shanxi province, China. SBS symptoms in students were surveyed, and \nmicrobial taxa and functional pathways related to the symptoms were identified \nusing a multi-level linear regression model. SBS symptoms were common in \nstudents, and the prevalence of ocular and throat symptoms, headache, and \ntiredness was higher in urban than in rural areas (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). A significant \nhigher microbial α-diversity was found in rural areas than in urban areas \n(Chao1, p\u202f=\u202f0.001; ACE, p\u202f=\u202f0.002). Also, significant variation in microbial \ntaxonomic and functional composition (β-diversity) was observed between urban \nand rural areas (p\u202f<\u202f0.005). Five potential risk Actinobacteria species were \nassociated with SBS symptoms (p\u202f<\u202f0.01); students in the classrooms with a \nhigher abundance of an unclassified Geodermatophilaceae, Geodermatophilus, \nFridmanniella luteola, Microlunatus phosphovorus and Mycetocola reported more \nnasal and throat symptoms and tiredness. Students with a higher abundance of an \nunclassified flavobacteriaceae reported fewer throat symptoms and tiredness.

However, the \nanti-fatigue mechanism underlying is still far from being clearly explained. The \naim of the study is to explore the underlying mechanism of the Maca compound \npreparation (MCP), a prescription for management of exercise-induced fatigue. In \nthis study, mice weight-loaded swimming test was used to evaluate the \nanti-fatigue effect of MCP. MCP significantly improved the forelimb grip \nstrength and Rota-rod test in behavioral tests via regulating energy metabolism. \n16S rDNA sequencing results showed MCP can regulate the intestinal flora at the \ngenus level by increasing several beneficial bacteria (i.e., Lactobacillus, \nAkkermansia and etc.), and decreasing the harmful bacteria (i.e., \nCandidatus_Planktophila and Candidatus_Arthromitus), where notable high \nrelevance was observed between the fatigue-related biomarkers and fecal \nmicrobiota. The results of microbial function analysis suggested that MCP might \nimprove exercise-induced fatigue by enhancing energy metabolism, carbohydrate \nand lipid metabolism and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides and breakdown \nof amino acid metabolism. In addition, and H2O2-induced oxidative stress model \non C2C12 cells was employed to further validate the regulation of MCP on energy \nmetabolisms. MCP pre-treatment significantly reduced intracellular ROS \naccumulation, and increased glycogen content, ATP generation capacity and \nmitochondrial membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells, as well as conferred \nanti-cell necrosis ability. In conclusion, MCP plays a key role in regulating \nfatigue occurrence in exercising and gut microbiota balance, which may be of \nparticular importance in the case of manual workers or sub-healthy populations.\n\nCopyright © 2022 Zhu, Wang, Hua, Qian and Du.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fnut.2022.1004174\nPMCID: PMC9597638\nPMID: 36313119\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

Subsequently, 120 \nactive ingredients and 116 fatigue-related targets played a cooperative role in \nmanaging fatigue, where several intestine-specific targets indicated the \nanti-fatigue mechanism of MCP might be closely related to its prebiotics of \nintestinal bacteria. Thus, forced swimming tests (FSTs) were carried and mice \nfecal samples were collected and analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing.

The objective of this study was to \ndetermine the blood microbial landscape in surgical patients and to explore its \npotential associations with postoperative sepsis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: 2825 patients who underwent surgical treatments were \nscreened for enrollment and 204 cases were recruited in this study. The patients \nwere sub-grouped into noninfected, infected, sepsis, and septic shock according \nto postoperative clinical manifestations. A total of 222 blood samples were \nobtained for neutrophil isolation, DNA extraction and high-throughput \nsequencing, quantitative proteomics analysis, and flow cytometric analyses.\nRESULTS: Blood and neutrophils in surgical patients and healthy controls \ncontained highly diverse microbiomes, mainly comprising Proteobacteria, \nActinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The majority (80.7%-91.5%) of the \nmicrobiomes were composed of gut-associated bacteria. The microbiomes in septic \npatients were significantly distinct from those of healthy controls, and marked \ndifferences in microbiome composition were observed between sepsis and septic \nshock groups. Several specific bacterial genera, including Flavobacterium, \nAgrococcus, Polynucleobacter, and Acidovorax, could distinguish patients with \nseptic shock from those with sepsis, with higher area under curve values. \nMoreover, Agrococcus, Polynucleobacter, and Acidovorax were positively \nassociated with the sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment scores \nand/or acute physiology and chronic health examination scores in septic shock \npatients. The proteins involved in bactericidal activities of neutrophils were \ndownregulated in septic patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: We present evidence identifying significant changes of blood and \nneutrophil-specific microbiomes across various stages of sepsis, which might be \nassociated with the progression of sepsis after surgical treatments. Several \ncertain bacterial genera in blood microbiome could have potential as microbial \nmarkers for early detection of sepsis.\n\n© 2021 The Authors.

The main objective of \nstudy was to focus on the impact of probiotic functional feed (PFF) on Nile \ntilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) exposed to challenges from Vibrio harveyi and \nVibrio parahaemolyticus. The investigation aims to analyze the genes linked to \nimmunity, hemato-biochemical indices, and the immunological response in tilapia. \nPFF is a vital component of fish feed production, providing suitable nutrition \nfor various ages and stages to promote healthy growth. The study comprises four \ntreatments: CPF-1 (control group, diet included solely of basal fish feed), the \n20% of PFF2 (Rossellomorea marisflavi spp. (DAS-SCF02-1\u2009×\u2009104), PFF3 (Agrococcus \nspp. (RKDAS1-1\u2009×\u2009106), and PFF4- (DAS-SCF02-1\u2009×\u2009104\u2009+\u2009RKDAS1 (1\u2009×\u2009107). A total \nof 150 Nile tilapia juveniles, weighing 2.56\u2009±\u20091.26\xa0g, were administered PFF in \ntriplicates. Significant improvements were observed in hematological indices, \nencompassing white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cells (RBC), \nhematocrit (Htc), and blood performance (BP) in probiotic-treated groups \ncompared to control. Biochemical analysis revealed lower levels of aspartate \naminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in fish fed with \nprobiotics, accompanied by increased total protein, albumin, and globulin \nlevels. Furthermore, probiotic-fed fish exhibited heightened blood glucose, \ntotal cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Immunological assessments \ndemonstrated increased lysozyme activity, intracellular superoxide anion \nproduction, reactive nitrogen species synthesis, and myeloperoxidase activity in \nprobiotic-fed groups. Immune gene expression analysis revealed up-regulation of \nstress response, cytokine signaling, and immune defense-related genes (HSP70, \nIL-1β, I C3, IFN-α, IFN-γ, GF1, GH, IL-1, and Lyz). In a Vibrio challenge study, \nprobiotic-fed fish exhibited improved survival rates, underscoring the \nprotective effects of probiotics against bacterial infections. Overall, this \nresearch underscores the multifaceted benefits of probiotic supplementation in \nenhancing the health and immunity of tilapia.\n\n© 2025.

Maintaining \nthe biological cleanliness of NASA's mission-associated cleanrooms, where \nspacecraft are assembled and tested, is critical for planetary protection. Even \nwith stringent controls such as regulated airflow, temperature management, and \nrigorous cleaning, resilient microorganisms can persist in these environments, \nposing potential risks for space missions.\nRESULTS: During the Phoenix spacecraft mission, genomes of 215 bacterial \nisolates were sequenced and based on overall genome-related indices, 53 strains \nbelonging to 26 novel species were recognized. Metagenome mapping indicated less \nthan 0.1% of the reads associated with novel species, suggesting their rarity. \nGenes responsible for biofilm formation, such as BolA (COG0271) and CvpA \n(COG1286), were predominantly found in proteobacterial members but were absent \nin other non-spore-forming and spore-forming species. YqgA (COG1811) was \ndetected in most spore-forming members but was absent in Paenibacillus and \nnon-spore-forming species. Cell fate regulators, COG1774 (YaaT), COG3679 (YlbF, \nYheA/YmcA), and COG4550 (YmcA, YheA/YmcA), controlling sporulation, competence, \nand biofilm development processes, were observed in all spore-formers but were \nmissing in non-spore-forming species. COG analyses further revealed \nresistance-conferring proteins in all spore-formers (n\u2009=\u200913 species) and eight \nactinobacterial species, responsible for enhanced membrane transport and \nsignaling under radiation (COG3253), transcription regulation under radiation \nstress (COG1108), and DNA repair and stress responses (COG2318). Additional \nfunctional analysis revealed that Agrococcus phoenicis, Microbacterium \ncanaveralium, and Microbacterium jpeli contained biosynthetic gene clusters \n(BGCs) for ε-poly-L-lysine, beneficial in food preservation and biomedical \napplications. Two novel Sphingomonas species exhibited\xa0for\xa0zeaxanthin, an \nantioxidant beneficial for eye health. Paenibacillus canaveralius harbored genes \nfor bacillibactin, crucial for iron acquisition. Georgenia phoenicis had BGCs \nfor alkylresorcinols, compounds with antimicrobial and anticancer properties \nused in food preservation and pharmaceuticals.\nCONCLUSION: Despite stringent decontamination and controlled environmental \nconditions, cleanrooms harbor unique bacterial species that form biofilms, \nresist various stressors, and produce valuable biotechnological compounds. The \nreduced microbial competition in these environments enhances the discovery of \nnovel microbial diversity, contributing to the mitigation of microbial \ncontamination and fostering biotechnological innovation.

This study adopted two groups of DWDSs to investigate how \nammonia nitrogen affects bacterial VFs and conditional pathogenic bacterial \ngrowth in biofilms. Our results indicated that Acidimicrobium \n(95,916.62\xa0±\xa0119.24 TPM), Limnohabitans (30,338.81\xa0±\xa0139.14 TPM), and \nSediminibacterium (10,658.01\xa0±\xa048.94 TPM) were predominant in the biofilm \nbacterial community of DWDSs with NH3-N addition. Under these conditions, the \nabundances of various bacterial metabolites, such as L-glutamate (1.45-fold), \n2-oxoglutarate (1.24-fold), pyruvate (2.10-fold), and adenosine monophosphate \n(AMP, 5.29-fold), were significantly upregulated, which suggested the \nupregulation of amino acid, carbohydrate, nucleotide, lipid, pyrimidine and \npurine metabolism. These metabolic pathways accelerated extracellular polymeric \nsubstance (EPS) secretion. The protein concentration in EPS also increased to \n187.59\xa0±\xa00.58\xa0μg/cm2. The increased EPS secretion promoted the amide I CO group \nof the EPS protein to interact with the surface of the DWDSs, thus enhancing the \nability of bacteria (especially conditional pathogenic bacteria) to adhere to \nthe pipe surface to form biofilms. Due to EPS protection, the abundance of the \nadherence subtype of VFs and the plate counts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa \nincreased to 5912.8\xa0±\xa021.89 TPM and 655.78\xa0±\xa027.10\xa0CFU/cm2, respectively. \nTherefore, NH3-N in DWDSs increased bacterial VFs levels and promoted the growth \nof some conditional pathogenic bacteria by regulating biofilm microbial \nmetabolic pathways and EPS secretion, ultimately impacting the interaction \nbetween EPS and the pipe surface.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the bacterial \ncommunities and physiochemical factors of the Qiujiang River, an important urban \nriver in Shanghai, were explored. Water samples were collected from nine sites \nof the Qiujiang River on November 16, 2020. The water quality and bacterial \ndiversity were studied through physicochemical detection, microbial culture and \nidentification, luminescence bacteria method, and 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq \nhigh-throughput sequencing technology. The water pollution of the Qiujiang River \nwas quite serious with three water quality evaluation indexes, including Cd2+, \nPb2+, and NH4+-N, exceeding the Class V standard set by the Environmental \nQuality Standards for Surface Water (China, GB3838-2002), while the luminescent \nbacteria test indicated low toxicity of nine sampling sites. Through 16S rRNA \nsequencing, a total of 45 phyla, 124 classes, and 963 genera were identified, in \nwhich Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Limnohabitans were the most \nabundant phylum, class, and genus, respectively. The Spearman correlation \nheatmap and redundancy analysis showed that the bacterial communities in the \nQiujiang River were correlated with pH; the concentrations of K+, and NH4+-N, \nand the Limnohabitans were significantly correlated with the concentrations of \nK+, and NH4+-N in the Zhongyuan Road bridge segment. In addition, opportunistic \npathogens Enterobacter cloacae complex and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the samples \ncollected in the Zhongyuan Road bridge segment and Huangpu River segment, \nrespectively, were successfully cultured. The Qiujiang River was a heavily \npolluted urban river. The bacterial community structure and diversity were \ngreatly affected by the physiochemical factors of the Qiujiang River, and it \ndisplayed low toxicity while a relatively high infectious risk of intestinal and \nlung infectious diseases.\n\n© 2023.

A potential control on bacterioplankton dynamics in these \nsystems is the availability of the essential metabolic cofactor thiamin (vitamin \nB1) and presence of the allelopathic thiamin antagonist bacimethrin, which \ncauses competitive inhibition of thiamin-requiring enzymes. We examined \ndissolved concentrations of thiamin chemical congeners and bacimethrin, 16S \namplicon-based microbiome compositions, prokaryotic mRNA-based \nmetatranscriptomes, and reference genomes in hypereutrophic Upper Klamath Basin \nbefore and during seasonal cyanoHABs. Our objective was to connect \nbacterioplankton community compositions and gene expression patterns with \nthiamin congener and bacimethrin availability under different cyanoHAB \nconditions. Bacimethrin was present in all samples at similar concentrations to \nthe thiamin precursor, HMP, suggesting that similar mechanisms influence the \navailability of both compounds. Additionally, bacimethrin concentrations were \npositively correlated with cyanoHAB species abundance (cells mL-1) and the \nexpression of microbial thiamin biosynthesis genes. Samples with high cyanoHAB \nabundance also displayed elevated transcription of genes in key biochemical \npathways such as the pentose phosphate pathway, photosynthesis, and glycogen \nbiosynthesis. Bacterioplankton such as Limnohabitans spp. that are unable to \nsynthesize thiamin, and are thus vulnerable to bacimethrin allelopathy, showed \nreduced gene expression when cyanoHAB abundance was high. Reference genomes of \ncyanoHAB and many picocyanobacteria strains contained complete thiamin \nbiosynthesis gene pathways, implicating these taxa as major thiamin sources. \nThese results suggest that bacimethrin provides a competitive advantage to \nbacterioplankton that do not require exogenous thiamin by eliminating the risk \nof bacimethrin uptake with thiamin transporters, potentially facilitating \ncyanoHAB dominance in Upper Klamath Basin and broader eutrophic watersheds.\n\nCopyright: This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be \nfreely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise \nused by anyone for any lawful purpose.

The differences between artificial and \nsemi-wild environments can directly affect the growth and development of \njuvenile alligators. This study analyzed the physical conditions (lengths and \nweights) and cloacal microbial communities of juvenile alligators in both \nartificial breeding (DJ, ZX) and semi-wild (GJM) environments to reveal the \nsignificant effects of environmental pressure on their physiological state and \nmicrobiome. The results revealed that the body length (23.15\u2009±\u20091.06\u2009cm) and \nweight (22.8\u2009±\u20093.08\u2009g) of juvenile alligators in the GJM were significantly \nlower than those in the artificial environment (body length\u2009=\u200929.5\u2009cm, \nweight\u2009=\u200968.6\u2009g; p\u2009<\u20090.01). Moreover, the microbial α diversity (ACE, Shannon) \nof the GJM was significantly reduced, and the community structure was \nsignificantly separated (NMDS analysis), suggesting that the pressure of the \nsemi-wild environment inhibited growth. In terms of microbial composition, the \nrelative abundance of Actinobacteria in the GJM group was significantly, \nincreased, whereas that of Bacteroidetes was decreased, and Microbacteria and \nCyanobacteria were unique; at the genus level, environmentally specific marker \ngenera were identified (such as Limnohabitans and Pseudomonas in GJM and \nFluviicola and Deinococcus in the artificial environments). LEfSe analysis \nfurther elucidated the differential marker microbiota (such as \nActinobacteria/Cyanobacteria in GJM). In summary, stress (such as food \nshortages) in semi-wild environments affects the growth and development of \njuvenile alligators by changing their microbial communities (such as enriched \nactinomycetes), This finding provides a microbial ecological basis for \noptimizing the conservation strategy of the Chinese alligator.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

In aquatic environments, Daphnia magna is ideal for \nstudying host-microbiome interactions due to its ecological importance and \nsensitivity. Adaptation to toxins, such as those produced by cyanobacteria, may \ninvolve both host and microbial gene repertoires. Yet, the influence of \nmicrobiota composition and function on host performance remains poorly \nunderstood. Because epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation regulate gene \nexpression and mediate adaptive responses, we also investigated whether these \nassociations are reflected in DNA methylation levels. To address this, we \nconducted a fully factorial transplant experiment using microbiota-depleted \nDaphnia colonised with microbiota from the same or different genotype, \npreviously exposed to toxic or nontoxic diets, or left uncolonised. We assessed \nlife-history traits, microbial composition (16S rRNA genes), functional profiles \n(whole-genome-resequencing), and DNA methylation (colorimetric quantification). \nDaphnia fed nontoxic diets grew larger and reproduced more. Increased \nmethylation occurred when microbiota donors differed from the host genotype and \nwas strongest under toxic diet. Dysbiosis and reduced performance were noted in \nindividuals colonised with toxic-diet microbiota from another genotype, where \nLimnohabitans spp. was reduced or absent. Signs of hormesis emerged when Daphnia \nreceived microbiota from their own genotype reared on nontoxic diets. DNA \nmethylation of both host and microbiota was associated with functional pathways, \nincluding increased mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis. These findings \nhighlight the importance of host-microbiota matching and microbial environmental \nhistory in shaping host performance and epigenetic responses, emphasizing the \nneed to consider host-microbe-environment interactions in evolutionary and \necological studies.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

The ecological health of this lake is influenced by elemental \ninputs and environmental parameters, yet its microbial and functional diversity \nremain poorly characterized. In this study, we employed a multi-omics approach \ncombining shotgun metagenomics, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry \n(ICP-MS), and culture-dependent analyses to provide an integrated understanding \nof the lake's microbial ecosystem. Shotgun metagenomics revealed taxonomic \ndiversity and functional gene profiles, ICP-MS quantified elemental composition \nand its potential role in shaping microbial communities, while culture-dependent \nmethods complemented metagenomic insights by isolating representative taxa. \nTogether, these approaches highlight the interactions between microbes and \nelemental dynamics, offering new perspectives on the ecological functioning of \nthis Himalayan wetland and its potential vulnerability to environmental change.\nRESULTS: ICP-MS analysis revealed phosphorus (P) as the most abundant element, \nfollowed by iron (Fe), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K). Elevated \nBOD and COD levels in sample KES4 indicated organic pollution and coincided with \nthe dominance of Microcystis aeruginosa, a cyanobacterium indicative of \neutrophication. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing generated approximately 213 \nmillion reads, with bacteria constituting 98.85% of the community. Dominant \nphyla included Pseudomonadota and Cyanobacteria. Culturable isolates confirmed \nthe presence of genera such as Limnohabitans, Microcystis, and \nMycolicibacterium. Functional gene profiling showed that metabolism was the most \nenriched category (71.64%), with several genes (e.g., xylB, pchF, clcD) \nassociated with xenobiotic degradation pathways.\nCONCLUSION: This first comprehensive metagenomic assessment of Khecheopalri Lake \nreveals diverse microbial populations involved in nutrient cycling and pollutant \ndetoxification.

Therefore, a hypothesis was made that higher urinary and \nvaginal microbiome diversity would be associated with increased urinary \nincontinence severity.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test whether specific urinary or vaginal \nmicrobiome community types are associated with urinary incontinence severity in \na population of women with mixed urinary incontinence.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This planned secondary, cross-sectional analysis evaluated \nassociations between the urinary and vaginal microbiomes and urinary \nincontinence severity in a subset of Effects of Surgical Treatment Enhanced With \nExercise for Mixed Urinary Incontinence trial participants with urinary \nincontinence. Incontinence severity was measured using bladder diaries and \nUrinary Distress Inventory questionnaires collected at baseline. Catheterized \nurine samples and vaginal swabs were concurrently collected before treatment at \nbaseline to assess the urinary and vaginal microbiomes. Of note, 16S rRNA V4 to \nV6 variable regions were sequenced, characterizing bacterial taxa to the genus \nlevel using the DADA2 pipeline and SILVA database. Using Dirichlet multinomial \nmixtures methods, samples were clustered into community types based on core \ntaxa. Associations between community types and severity measures (Urinary \nDistress Inventory total scores, Urinary Distress Inventory subscale scores, and \nthe number of urinary incontinence episodes [total, urgency, and stress] from \nthe bladder diary) were evaluated using linear regression models adjusted for \nage and body mass index. In addition, alpha diversity measures for richness \n(total taxa numbers) and evenness (proportional distribution of taxa abundance) \nwere analyzed for associations with urinary incontinence episodes and community \ntype.\nRESULTS: Overall, 6 urinary microbiome community types were identified, \ncharacterized by varying levels of common genera (Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, \nPrevotella, Tepidimonas, Acidovorax, Escherichia, and others). The analysis of \nurinary incontinence severity in 126 participants with mixed urinary \nincontinence identified a Lactobacillus-dominated reference group with the \nhighest abundance of Lactobacillus (mean relative abundance of 76%). A community \ncharacterized by fewer Lactobacilli (mean relative abundance of 19%) and greater \nalpha diversity was associated with higher total urinary incontinence episodes \n(2.67 daily leaks; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-4.59; P=.007) and urgency \nurinary incontinence episodes (1.75 daily leaks; 95% confidence interval, \n0.24-3.27; P=.02) than the reference group. No significant association was \nobserved between community type and stress urinary incontinence episodes or \nUrogenital Distress Inventory total or subscores. The composition of vaginal \ncommunity types and urinary community types were similar but composed of \nslightly different bacterial taxa. Vaginal community types were not associated \nwith urinary incontinence severity, as measured by bladder diary or Urogenital \nDistress Inventory total and subscale scores. Alpha diversity indicated that \ngreater sample richness was associated with more incontinence episodes (observed \ngenera P=.01) in urine. Measures of evenness (Shannon and Pielou) were not \nassociated with incontinence severity in the urinary or vaginal microbiomes.\nCONCLUSION: In the urobiome of women with mixed urinary incontinence, a \ncommunity type with fewer Lactobacilli and more diverse bacteria was associated \nwith more severe urinary incontinence episodes (total and urgency) compared with \na community type with high predominance of a single genus, Lactobacillus. \nWhether mixed urinary incontinence severity is due to lesser predominance of \nLactobacillus, greater presence of other non-Lactobacillus genera, or the \ncomplement of bacteria consisting of urobiome community types remains to be \ndetermined.\n\nCopyright © 2023.

Subjective response was defined \nas a change from baseline in the Urogenital Distress Inventory scores. Bacterial \nabundance and beta diversity were assessed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. \nThe primary differential abundance analysis described predominant bacterial \noperational taxonomic units associated with responders vs nonresponders using \nunadjusted and age-adjusted linear models.\nRESULTS: Objective nonresponders (n=28) compared with responders (n=72) were \nolder (58.5±10.7 vs 51.6±10.2 years) and more likely postmenopausal without \nhormone use (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-22.6). Vaginal and \nurinary microbiota beta diversities were associated with age (P<.05) for both \nresponders and nonresponders. Overall, predominant operational taxonomic units \n(genera) were Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Tepidimonas, Escherichia, \nStreptococcus, and Prevotella. Operational taxonomic units from baseline urine \nsamples were not significantly associated (P threshold=.05) with surgical \ntreatment responses. A greater abundance of baseline vaginal Lactobacillus was \nassociated with an objective response (P=.04) and Prevotella with an objective \nnonresponse (P=.01). Adjusting for age, only a greater abundance of baseline \nvaginal Prevotella was associated with an objective nonresponse (P=.01). \nMoreover, less abundant vaginal operational taxonomic units were associated with \nobjective and subjective responses and persistent urinary incontinence symptoms \n(P<.05).\nCONCLUSION: Women meeting a 70% reduction of urinary incontinence treatment \nepisodes (objective responders) had greater vaginal Lactobacillus at the time of \nthe surgical procedure; however, controlling for age diminished this \nassociation. Women not meeting a 70% reduction of urinary incontinence episodes \n1 year after a midurethral sling operation had greater vaginal Prevotella at the \ntime of the midurethral sling operation. Further research is needed to determine \nwhether therapy altering the vaginal microbiome may impact surgical treatment \nresponses in women with mixed urinary incontinence.\n\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to characterize \nthe molecular immune response distribution within the ileal layers and to \nevaluate the correlated microbiota in pathological/healthy settings comparing \nfirst surgery/relapse clinical conditions.\nMETHODS: We enrolled 12 CD patients. A comprehensive analysis of an ileal \nmucosa, submucosa and serosa broad-spectrum cytokine panel was performed through \na multiplex approach. In addition, ileal microbiota composition was assessed \nthrough next generation sequencing.\nRESULTS: We observed a distinct profile [of IL1-α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-8, ICAM-1, \nE-Selectin, P-Selectin, IP-10, IL 6 and IL 18] across the CD vs healthy ileal \nlayers; and a different distribution of IFN- γ, P-Selectin, IL-27 and IL-21 in \nfirst surgery vs relapse patients. In addition, the phylum Tenericutes, the \nfamily Ruminococcaceae, and the genera Mesoplasma and Mycoplasma were \nsignificantly enriched in the pathological setting. Significant microbiota \ndifferences were observed between relapse and first surgery patients regarding \nthe class Bacteroidia, and the genera Prevotella, Flavobacterium, Tepidimonas \nand Escherichia/Shigella. Finally, the abundance of the genus Mycoplasma was \npositively correlated with IL-18.\nCONCLUSIONS: We describe a dissimilarity of cytokine distribution and microbiota \ncomposition within CD and adjacent healthy ileal tissue layers and between first \noperation and surgical relapse. Our results give potential insight into the \ndynamics of the gut microbiota-immune axis in CD patients, leading to detection \nof new biomarkers.\n\n© The Author(s) 2021.

While prevalent in high-temperature ecosystems, the mechanisms \nregulating temperature-dependent denitrification remain unclear. To address this \ngap, we used hot springs with different temperatures (ranging from 37 to 75 °C) \nas representative environments and conducted enrichment cultures with both in \nsitu hot spring water and defined media with varying acetate/NO3- ratios. \nDenitrification product profiles shifted systematically with temperature: NO2- \ndominated above 60 °C, NO2- and N2O at 55 °C, and N2 below 45 °C. Multiomics \nanalyses revealed temperature-driven succession of dominant denitrifiers, with \nmicroorganisms affiliated with Thermus (>60 °C), Tepidimonas (55 °C), and \nThauera/Uliginosibacterium (<45 °C). Denitrification core and accessory gene \nexpressions showed temperature-specific patterns associated with intermediate \nformation. High expression of upstream core genes (e.g., narG) and limited \nexpression of accessory genes in Thermus spp. promote incomplete denitrification \nat high temperatures, while low-temperature communities upregulated \ncomplementary pathways (e.g., nosRD with nosZ in Thauera spp.) for complete \ndenitrification. Division of metabolic labor appears to be more important in \ndenitrifying communities at high temperatures, where dominant denitrifiers \nperform incomplete denitrification and downstream intermediates are reduced by \nminor species (e.g., N2O reduction). These findings improve understanding of \ndenitrification in thermally dynamic environments and reveal mechanisms \nunderlying its temperature-dependent regulation.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.est.5c00174\nPMID: 40523199 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"},

We revealed these aspects of a bacteria-dominated microbiome (microbial \ncell density ~8.5 × 104 mL-1; live:dead cell ratio 1.7) thriving in the boiling \n(85°C) fluid vented by a sulfur-borax spring called Lotus Pond, situated at 4436 \nm above the mean sea-level, in the Puga valley of eastern Ladakh, on the \nChangthang plateau. Assembly, annotation, and population-binning of >15-GB \nmetagenomic sequence illuminated the numeral predominance of Aquificae. While \nmembers of this phylum accounted for 80% of all 16S rRNA-encoding reads within \nthe metagenomic dataset, 14% of such reads were attributed to Proteobacteria. \nPost assembly, only 25% of all protein-coding genes identified were attributable \nto Aquificae, whereas 41% was ascribed to Proteobacteria. Annotation of \nmetagenomic reads encoding 16S rRNAs, and/or PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes, \nidentified 163 bacterial genera, out of which 66 had been detected in past \ninvestigations of Lotus Pond's vent-water via 16S amplicon sequencing. Among \nthese 66, Fervidobacterium, Halomonas, Hydrogenobacter, Paracoccus, \nSulfurihydrogenibium, Tepidimonas, Thermus and Thiofaba (or their close \nphylogenomic relatives) were presently detected as metagenome-assembled genomes \n(MAGs). Remarkably, the Hydrogenobacter related MAG alone accounted for ~56% of \nthe entire metagenome, even though only 15 out of the 66 genera consistently \npresent in Lotus Pond's vent-water have strains growing in the laboratory at \n>45°C, reflecting the continued existence of the mesophiles in the ecosystem. \nFurthermore, the metagenome was replete with genes crucial for thermal \nadaptation in the context of Lotus Pond's geochemistry and topography. In terms \nof sequence similarity, a majority of those genes were attributable to \nphylogenetic relatives of mesophilic bacteria, while functionally they rendered \nfunctions such as encoding heat shock proteins, molecular chaperones, and \nchaperonin complexes; proteins controlling/modulating/inhibiting DNA gyrase; \nuniversal stress proteins; methionine sulfoxide reductases; fatty acid \ndesaturases; different toxin-antitoxin systems; enzymes protecting against \noxidative damage; proteins conferring flagellar structure/function, chemotaxis, \ncell adhesion/aggregation, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing. The Lotus Pond \nAquificae not only dominated the microbiome numerically but also acted \npotentially as the main primary producers of the ecosystem, with \nchemolithotrophic sulfur oxidation (Sox) being the fundamental bioenergetic \nmechanism, and reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle the predominant carbon \nfixation pathway. The Lotus Pond metagenome contained several genes directly or \nindirectly related to virulence functions, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites \nincluding antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and multi-drug efflux pumping. A \nlarge proportion of these genes being attributable to Aquificae, and \nProteobacteria (very few were ascribed to Archaea), it could be worth exploring \nin the future whether antibiosis helped the Aquificae overcome niche overlap \nwith other thermophiles (especially those belonging to Archaea), besides \nexacerbating the bioenergetic costs of thermal endurance for the mesophilic \nintruders of the ecosystem.\n\nCopyright: © 2024 Mondal et al.

Therefore, a hypothesis was made that higher urinary and \nvaginal microbiome diversity would be associated with increased urinary \nincontinence severity.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test whether specific urinary or vaginal \nmicrobiome community types are associated with urinary incontinence severity in \na population of women with mixed urinary incontinence.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This planned secondary, cross-sectional analysis evaluated \nassociations between the urinary and vaginal microbiomes and urinary \nincontinence severity in a subset of Effects of Surgical Treatment Enhanced With \nExercise for Mixed Urinary Incontinence trial participants with urinary \nincontinence. Incontinence severity was measured using bladder diaries and \nUrinary Distress Inventory questionnaires collected at baseline. Catheterized \nurine samples and vaginal swabs were concurrently collected before treatment at \nbaseline to assess the urinary and vaginal microbiomes. Of note, 16S rRNA V4 to \nV6 variable regions were sequenced, characterizing bacterial taxa to the genus \nlevel using the DADA2 pipeline and SILVA database. Using Dirichlet multinomial \nmixtures methods, samples were clustered into community types based on core \ntaxa. Associations between community types and severity measures (Urinary \nDistress Inventory total scores, Urinary Distress Inventory subscale scores, and \nthe number of urinary incontinence episodes [total, urgency, and stress] from \nthe bladder diary) were evaluated using linear regression models adjusted for \nage and body mass index. In addition, alpha diversity measures for richness \n(total taxa numbers) and evenness (proportional distribution of taxa abundance) \nwere analyzed for associations with urinary incontinence episodes and community \ntype.\nRESULTS: Overall, 6 urinary microbiome community types were identified, \ncharacterized by varying levels of common genera (Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, \nPrevotella, Tepidimonas, Acidovorax, Escherichia, and others). The analysis of \nurinary incontinence severity in 126 participants with mixed urinary \nincontinence identified a Lactobacillus-dominated reference group with the \nhighest abundance of Lactobacillus (mean relative abundance of 76%). A community \ncharacterized by fewer Lactobacilli (mean relative abundance of 19%) and greater \nalpha diversity was associated with higher total urinary incontinence episodes \n(2.67 daily leaks; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-4.59; P=.007) and urgency \nurinary incontinence episodes (1.75 daily leaks; 95% confidence interval, \n0.24-3.27; P=.02) than the reference group. No significant association was \nobserved between community type and stress urinary incontinence episodes or \nUrogenital Distress Inventory total or subscores. The composition of vaginal \ncommunity types and urinary community types were similar but composed of \nslightly different bacterial taxa. Vaginal community types were not associated \nwith urinary incontinence severity, as measured by bladder diary or Urogenital \nDistress Inventory total and subscale scores. Alpha diversity indicated that \ngreater sample richness was associated with more incontinence episodes (observed \ngenera P=.01) in urine. Measures of evenness (Shannon and Pielou) were not \nassociated with incontinence severity in the urinary or vaginal microbiomes.\nCONCLUSION: In the urobiome of women with mixed urinary incontinence, a \ncommunity type with fewer Lactobacilli and more diverse bacteria was associated \nwith more severe urinary incontinence episodes (total and urgency) compared with \na community type with high predominance of a single genus, Lactobacillus. \nWhether mixed urinary incontinence severity is due to lesser predominance of \nLactobacillus, greater presence of other non-Lactobacillus genera, or the \ncomplement of bacteria consisting of urobiome community types remains to be \ndetermined.\n\nCopyright © 2023.

Here, we \naimed to heterologously express 18 HSP20s from 12 thermotolerant bacteria in \nEscherichia coli and evaluate their effects on various physical and chemical \ncellular stresses. Seventeen HSP20s were successfully expressed as soluble \nproteins. Recombinant E. coli cells were subjected to heat, cold, acidic, \nalkaline, and hyperosmolar stress to evaluate the effects of HSP20 proteins on \nstress resistance. Notably, the overexpression of 15 HSP20s enhanced the stress \nresistance of E. coli compared to that of the control strain. In particular, \nHSPs from Tepidimonas sediminis and Oceanithermus profundus improved the stress \ntolerance of E. coli under all tested conditions. In addition, E. coli harboring \nHSP20 from T. sediminis retained cell viability even after heat treatment at \n52\xa0°C for 5\xa0days. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. coli \ntolerance to prolonged (>\u2009100\xa0h) high-temperature stress.

To test these hypotheses \nusing controlled experiments animal models are needed. Therefore, we \ninvestigated the microbiome in the gut and mammary tissue in a mouse model of \nbreast cancer. C57BL/6 mice expressing the polyoma middle T antigen in the \nmammary gland (PyMT) develop spontaneous multifocal breast tumors. Microbiota in \nthe gut and mammary tissue were studied prior to and after development of \nmammary gland tumors by amplicon and shotgun DNA sequencing. In parallel, RNA \nsequencing was performed on tumor and normal tissue to measure differences in \ngene expression associated with breast cancer. Bacteria identified in these \nstudies were administered to mice to test their effects on cancer progression. \nBacterial community composition in the gut of healthy or tumor-bearing mice \nshowed wide fluctuation over time and did not organize into discrete clusters. \nIn tumor versus healthy mammary gland tissue, relative abundances of six \nbacteria were significantly different: Ralstonia, Methylobacterium, Pelomonas, \nStaphylococcus and Tepidimonas. Methlyobacterium sequences were significantly \nhigher (PERMANOVA, P = 0.013) in healthy tissue when compared to tumor, leading \nto a hypothesis that Methylobacterium may promote health. When co-transplanted \nwith breast tumor cells, Methylobacterium reduced growth in immune competent \nmice.

We revealed these aspects of a bacteria-dominated microbiome (microbial \ncell density ~8.5 × 104 mL-1; live:dead cell ratio 1.7) thriving in the boiling \n(85°C) fluid vented by a sulfur-borax spring called Lotus Pond, situated at 4436 \nm above the mean sea-level, in the Puga valley of eastern Ladakh, on the \nChangthang plateau. Assembly, annotation, and population-binning of >15-GB \nmetagenomic sequence illuminated the numeral predominance of Aquificae. While \nmembers of this phylum accounted for 80% of all 16S rRNA-encoding reads within \nthe metagenomic dataset, 14% of such reads were attributed to Proteobacteria. \nPost assembly, only 25% of all protein-coding genes identified were attributable \nto Aquificae, whereas 41% was ascribed to Proteobacteria. Annotation of \nmetagenomic reads encoding 16S rRNAs, and/or PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes, \nidentified 163 bacterial genera, out of which 66 had been detected in past \ninvestigations of Lotus Pond's vent-water via 16S amplicon sequencing. Among \nthese 66, Fervidobacterium, Halomonas, Hydrogenobacter, Paracoccus, \nSulfurihydrogenibium, Tepidimonas, Thermus and Thiofaba (or their close \nphylogenomic relatives) were presently detected as metagenome-assembled genomes \n(MAGs). Remarkably, the Hydrogenobacter related MAG alone accounted for ~56% of \nthe entire metagenome, even though only 15 out of the 66 genera consistently \npresent in Lotus Pond's vent-water have strains growing in the laboratory at \n>45°C, reflecting the continued existence of the mesophiles in the ecosystem. \nFurthermore, the metagenome was replete with genes crucial for thermal \nadaptation in the context of Lotus Pond's geochemistry and topography. In terms \nof sequence similarity, a majority of those genes were attributable to \nphylogenetic relatives of mesophilic bacteria, while functionally they rendered \nfunctions such as encoding heat shock proteins, molecular chaperones, and \nchaperonin complexes; proteins controlling/modulating/inhibiting DNA gyrase; \nuniversal stress proteins; methionine sulfoxide reductases; fatty acid \ndesaturases; different toxin-antitoxin systems; enzymes protecting against \noxidative damage; proteins conferring flagellar structure/function, chemotaxis, \ncell adhesion/aggregation, biofilm formation, and quorum sensing. The Lotus Pond \nAquificae not only dominated the microbiome numerically but also acted \npotentially as the main primary producers of the ecosystem, with \nchemolithotrophic sulfur oxidation (Sox) being the fundamental bioenergetic \nmechanism, and reductive tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle the predominant carbon \nfixation pathway. The Lotus Pond metagenome contained several genes directly or \nindirectly related to virulence functions, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites \nincluding antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and multi-drug efflux pumping. A \nlarge proportion of these genes being attributable to Aquificae, and \nProteobacteria (very few were ascribed to Archaea), it could be worth exploring \nin the future whether antibiosis helped the Aquificae overcome niche overlap \nwith other thermophiles (especially those belonging to Archaea), besides \nexacerbating the bioenergetic costs of thermal endurance for the mesophilic \nintruders of the ecosystem.\n\nCopyright: © 2024 Mondal et al.

Therefore, a hypothesis was made that higher urinary and \nvaginal microbiome diversity would be associated with increased urinary \nincontinence severity.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test whether specific urinary or vaginal \nmicrobiome community types are associated with urinary incontinence severity in \na population of women with mixed urinary incontinence.\nSTUDY DESIGN: This planned secondary, cross-sectional analysis evaluated \nassociations between the urinary and vaginal microbiomes and urinary \nincontinence severity in a subset of Effects of Surgical Treatment Enhanced With \nExercise for Mixed Urinary Incontinence trial participants with urinary \nincontinence. Incontinence severity was measured using bladder diaries and \nUrinary Distress Inventory questionnaires collected at baseline. Catheterized \nurine samples and vaginal swabs were concurrently collected before treatment at \nbaseline to assess the urinary and vaginal microbiomes. Of note, 16S rRNA V4 to \nV6 variable regions were sequenced, characterizing bacterial taxa to the genus \nlevel using the DADA2 pipeline and SILVA database. Using Dirichlet multinomial \nmixtures methods, samples were clustered into community types based on core \ntaxa. Associations between community types and severity measures (Urinary \nDistress Inventory total scores, Urinary Distress Inventory subscale scores, and \nthe number of urinary incontinence episodes [total, urgency, and stress] from \nthe bladder diary) were evaluated using linear regression models adjusted for \nage and body mass index. In addition, alpha diversity measures for richness \n(total taxa numbers) and evenness (proportional distribution of taxa abundance) \nwere analyzed for associations with urinary incontinence episodes and community \ntype.\nRESULTS: Overall, 6 urinary microbiome community types were identified, \ncharacterized by varying levels of common genera (Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, \nPrevotella, Tepidimonas, Acidovorax, Escherichia, and others). The analysis of \nurinary incontinence severity in 126 participants with mixed urinary \nincontinence identified a Lactobacillus-dominated reference group with the \nhighest abundance of Lactobacillus (mean relative abundance of 76%). A community \ncharacterized by fewer Lactobacilli (mean relative abundance of 19%) and greater \nalpha diversity was associated with higher total urinary incontinence episodes \n(2.67 daily leaks; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-4.59; P=.007) and urgency \nurinary incontinence episodes (1.75 daily leaks; 95% confidence interval, \n0.24-3.27; P=.02) than the reference group. No significant association was \nobserved between community type and stress urinary incontinence episodes or \nUrogenital Distress Inventory total or subscores. The composition of vaginal \ncommunity types and urinary community types were similar but composed of \nslightly different bacterial taxa. Vaginal community types were not associated \nwith urinary incontinence severity, as measured by bladder diary or Urogenital \nDistress Inventory total and subscale scores. Alpha diversity indicated that \ngreater sample richness was associated with more incontinence episodes (observed \ngenera P=.01) in urine. Measures of evenness (Shannon and Pielou) were not \nassociated with incontinence severity in the urinary or vaginal microbiomes.\nCONCLUSION: In the urobiome of women with mixed urinary incontinence, a \ncommunity type with fewer Lactobacilli and more diverse bacteria was associated \nwith more severe urinary incontinence episodes (total and urgency) compared with \na community type with high predominance of a single genus, Lactobacillus. \nWhether mixed urinary incontinence severity is due to lesser predominance of \nLactobacillus, greater presence of other non-Lactobacillus genera, or the \ncomplement of bacteria consisting of urobiome community types remains to be \ndetermined.\n\nCopyright © 2023.

To test the hypothesis \nthat P. maydis can interact with other foliar microorganisms, we investigated \nphyllosphere microbiomes in relation to corn inbreds with differential tar spot \nsymptoms under natural field infestation. Sixteen inbred lines were assessed for \ntar spot symptoms, and bacterial and fungal microbiomes were characterized using \nIllumina MiSeq Sequencing. Comparison of the phyllosphere microbiomes revealed \ndistinct bacterial and fungal communities between resistant and susceptible \nlines in a sample-specific manner. Bacterial alpha diversity did not differ \nsignificantly between susceptible and resistant lines, while fungal diversity \n(richness, evenness, and phylogenetic diversity) was significantly higher in \nresistant lines. Beta diversity analysis revealed significant structural \ndifferences in both bacterial and fungal communities, with fungal differences \nmore pronounced and driven by relative abundance. Resistant lines were \nassociated with plant-beneficial bacterial genera such as Quadrisphaera, Klenkia \nand Nocardioides and fungal genera Cladosporium, Coniothyrium, Alternaria, \nEpicoccum, Bipolaris, Phyllozyma, and Papiliotrema, while susceptible lines were \ndominated by Erwiniaceae, Aureimonas, Pseudomonas, Microbacterium, and \nDeinococcus and fungal genera Hannaella, Paraphaeosphaeria, Sphaerellopsis and \nPhyllachora. Coniothyrium, a potential mycoparasite of P. maydis, was also \ndetected but whether it is the same species that was identified in Central and \nSouth America is unknown. Our findings imply that P. maydis infection may result \nin a distinct, less diverse microbiome.

Correlation \nanalysis between P. maydis reads and abundant taxa revealed a predominance of \nnegative correlations, suggesting increased ecological niche differentiation \ndriven by intense competition within the microbial community. These findings \nsuggest that P. maydis infection is associated with a less diverse microbiome \nand that specific microbial taxa may play roles in P. maydis susceptibility and \nresistance.

Plant-recruited protective microbes \ncan be assembled into synthetic communities to combat infections caused by Fon. \nThe objective of this project was to assemble a simplified synthetic community \nfor use in controlling Fusarium wilt in watermelon.\nRESULTS: The Shannon diversity of the bacterial community in the roots and \nrhizosphere of healthy watermelon plants was significantly higher than that of \ndiseased plants. Under Fon challenge, healthy watermelon plants recruited \ncertain beneficial bacteria taxa, such as Lysobacter, Microbacterium, \nNocardioides and Sphingobium to the rhizosphere and roots. We identified the top \nten bacterial genera enriched in the rhizosphere of healthy watermelon plants \nand utilized them to construct a disease-resistant synthetic community (SynCom \nI). After the joint selection of plants and pathogens, the synthetic community \n(SynCom I) containing ten bacteria was further simplified into a five-species \ncommunity comprising Bacillus methylotrophicus J4, Agromyces mediolanus L1P43F5, \nMicrobacterium maritypicum L2P04F12, Sphingobium mellinum L2P11G4 and \nChryseobacterium lactis L1P41C5. The simplified synthetic community demonstrated \na control efficacy of 99.6%, and the five-species members presented a \ncross-feeding interaction model. Removal of any one of B. methylotrophicus J4, \nChryseobacterium lactis L1P41C5 and Sphingobium mellinum L2P11G4 led to an \nincrease in the incidence rate compared with the synthetic community. In \naddition, B. methylotrophicus J4 and Chryseobacterium lactis L1P41C5 \nsignificantly promoted plant growth.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that specific bacterial taxa enriched in the \nrhizosphere of healthy plants are correlated with enhanced disease resistance. \nConsequently, the construction and simplification of synthetic communities \nobserved in this study may represent a strategy utilized by plants to mitigate \nthe impact of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum. © 2025 Society of Chemical \nIndustry.\n\n© 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ps.70193\nPMID: 40899312'},

In clinical practice, it is often divided into \nZiQin and KuQin according to their growth years and different medicinal \npurposes. Extensive herbal research and pharmacological studies have \ndemonstrated distinct effects of ZiQin and KuQin. Therefore, we collected \nHuangQin along with its rhizosphere soils at different growth stages to \ninvestigate the impact of soil microorganisms on flavonoid synthesis in \nHuangQin.\nMETHODS: In this study, high-throughput sequencing and UPLC-MS/MS-based \nmetabolomics method were employed for the analysis of 16S rDNA sequences in \nHuangQin rhizosphere soil samples and metabolic profiling of HuangQin, \nrespectively.\nRESULTS: The results revealed that the number of operational taxonomic units \n(OTUs) for the four years were 7594, 10,227, 10,280, and 9796, respectively. \nFurthermore, an extended cultivation period led to a gradual decrease in the \nabundance of Pseudarthrobacter, Achromobacter and other beneficial bacteria. In \naddition to this, a total of 552 secondary metabolites were identified in the \nmetabolome. The analysis revealed that 56 components could be successfully \nmapped to the KEGG database, encompassing five distinct metabolic pathways: \nisoflavonoid biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary \nmetabolites, flavonoid biosynthesis and flavone and flavanol biosynthesis. \nCorrelation analysis between soil physicochemical properties and differential \nmicroorganisms demonstrated significant associations: Pseudarthrobacter \nexhibited strong correlations with TN (total nitrogen), AN (ammonium nitrogen), \nAK (available potassium), and NH4+-N; Nocardioides displayed notable \ncorrelations with TN and AK as well as a significant association with AN and pH; \nHaliangium showed a significant correlation with AP (available phosphorus).\nCONCLUSION: The results suggest that flavonoid accumulation in S. baicalensis \nmay be influenced by soil physicochemical properties and rhizosphere \nmicroorganisms, providing a valuable basis for future research on optimizing \ncultivation practices.\n\n© 2025.

Early diagnosis of \nTB is still a challenge. Studies are seeking non-sputum biomarker-based TB test. \nEmerging evidence indicates potential significance of blood microbiome \nsignatures for diseases. However, blood microbiome RNA profiles are unknown in \nTB. We aimed to characterize the blood microbiome of TB patients and identify \nMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genome-derived small RNA molecules to serve as \ndiagnostic biomarkers for TB.\nMETHODS: RNA sequencing data of the blood from TB patients and healthy controls \nwere retrieved from the NCBI-SRA database for analyzing the blood microbiome and \nidentifying rRNA-derived small RNA (rsRNA) of Mtb. Small RNA-seq was performed \non plasma exosomes from TB patients and healthy controls. The levels of the \ncandidate Mtb rsRNAs were determined by real-time quantitative reverse \ntranscription PCR (RT-qPCR) on plasma from a separate cohort of 73\xa0TB patients \nand 62 healthy controls.\nRESULTS: The blood microbiome of TB patients consisted of RNA signals from \nbacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses, with bacteria accounting for more than \n97% of the total. Reduced blood microbial diversity and abundance of 6 \nMycobacterium-associated bacterial genera, including Mycobacterium, Priestia, \nNocardioides, Agrobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, and Escherichia, were significantly \naltered in the blood of TB patients. A diagnostic model for TB based on the 6 \ngenera achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8945. rsRNAs mapped to the \nMtb genome were identified from blood and plasma exosomes of TB patients. \nRT-qPCR results showed that 2 Mtb-derived rsRNAs, 16\xa0S-L1 and 16\xa0S-L2, could be \nused as diagnostic biomarkers to differentiate TB patients from healthy \ncontrols, with a high co-diagnostic efficacy (AUC\u2009=\u20090.7197).\nCONCLUSIONS: A panel of blood microbiome signatures and Mtb-derived rsRNAs can \nserve as blood biomarkers for TB diagnosis.\n\n© 2025.

This study integrates \n16S rRNA gene profiling, whole-metagenome sequencing, and virome analysis to \nelucidate how microbial and viral communities within the earthworm gut \ncontribute to nutrient biosynthesis, xenobiotic degradation, and environmental \nadaptation. Earthworms reared on compost feed enriched with Quisqualis indica \nplant matter showed selective enrichment of bacterial genera such as \nOhtaekwangia, Nocardioides, and Steroidobacter, which are associated with \nhydrocarbon degradation and aromatic compound detoxification. Functional \nannotation of the gut metagenome revealed complete biosynthetic pathways for \nriboflavin, lysine, and methionine, and degradation routes for 3-nitropropionic \nacid (3-NPA) and aromatic pollutants. The gut virome, dominated by Siphoviridae \nand Myoviridae, carried auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) related to redox and \nxenobiotic metabolism, highlighting viral contributions to microbial \nadaptability. Reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including a \nhigh-quality Flavobacterium MAG encoding both riboflavin biosynthesis and \ndenitrification genes, underscored metabolic specialization within the gut. \nCollectively, these findings demonstrate that bacterial-viral metabolic synergy \nunderpins E. fetida survival and ecological resilience, suggesting new \nmicrobiome-informed strategies for biowaste valorization and soil health \nrestoration through vermicomposting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were \nemployed to evaluate the rhizosphere microbiome, and redundancy analysis was \nutilized to investigate the relationship between the microbial communities and \nsoil nutrient indicators.\nRESULTS: TM2 and TM3 increased soil bacterial community diversity, reduced \nfungal community diversity, elevated the relative abundance of beneficial \nbacterial genera, and reduced the abundance of detrimental fungal genera in the \nrhizosphere soil. The relative abundance of Pseudarthrobacter, \nunclassified_Steroidobacteraceae, and Nocardioides in TM2 and TM3 was markedly \nhigher than in TM1. Conversely, the relative abundance of Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, \nCeratobasidium, and Plectosphaerella in TM2 and TM3 was significantly reduced \ncompared to TM1. The contents of available potassium (AK), total nitrogen (TN), \ntotal phosphorus (TP), and pH in the rhizosphere soil of TM2 and TM3 were \nsignificantly higher than those in TM1. The distribution of soil bacterial \ngenera was significantly influenced by the contents of TN and AK, while the \ndistribution of soil fungal genera was significantly or extremely significantly \nimpacted by the contents of TP, total potassium (TK), soil organic matter (SOM), \nand pH. The content of AK was extremely significantly positively correlated with \nthe relative abundance of Nocardioides, whereas the content of TK showed an \nextremely negative correlation with the relative abundance of Ceratobasidium. \nSimilarly, pH demonstrated an extremely negative correlation with the relative \nabundance of Rhizoctonia and Ceratobasidium.\nCONCLUSIONS: Film-mulched cultivation and soybean intercropping cultivation \naltered the soil nutrients, as well as the structure and diversity of soil \nmicrobial communities. Thus, in agricultural production, film-mulched \ncultivation and soybean intercropping cultivation can serve to regulate soil \nnutrients and microbial communities, thereby mitigating the barriers of \ncontinuous cropping of T. kirilowii.\n\n© 2025 Zheng et al.\n\nDOI: 10.7717/peerj.20459\nPMCID: PMC12665268\nPMID: 41328072 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing \ninterests.'},

In the Guadalquivir Marshes of \nsouthwestern Spain, which encompass both Doñana National Park and one of \nEurope's most productive rice cultivation areas, decades of rice farming have \ntransformed natural wetlands into artificial agroecosystems. Although bacterial \ndegradation in cultivated soils has been previously suggested, comparative \nanalyses between rice paddies and adjacent natural wetlands remain scarce.Here, \nwe characterized the soil bacteriome across a cultivation gradient by comparing \nundisturbed natural marshes, within Doñana National Park, with rice fields \ncultivated for 25\xa0years (Cantarita) and 80\xa0years (Mínima 2). Using full 16S rRNA \ngene via long-read metabarcoding and standardized soil physicochemical assays, \nwe analysed taxonomic composition, environmental associations, and predicted \nfunctional profiles.Our results reveal a progressive restructuring of bacterial \ncommunities with increased cultivation time, notably a significant enrichment of \nChloroflexota (especially Anaerolineae) and a decline in Actinomycetota and \nPlanctomycetota in paddy soils. Functional predictions indicated a higher \npotential for denitrification in cultivated soils-likely involving Chloroflexota \ntaxa-compared to more diverse nitrogen pathways in natural sites. These shifts \nwere strongly associated with changes in pH, electrical conductivity, calcium \ncarbonate, and nitrate levels. Remarkably, most bacterial differences were \nalready evident within the first 25\xa0years of cultivation, underscoring the rapid \necological impact of intensive rice cultivation.Notably, we identified specific \nbacterial groups (Anaerolineae and Nocardioides in paddy soils; Euzebya, \nRubrobacter, and Planctomycetota in natural wetlands), whose enrichment was \nassociated with soil type. This approach highlights the value of integrating \nbacterial-based assessments into sustainable wetland management strategies.\n\n© 2025.

The patient sought medical attention at \nour hospital due to "a right back lump for 2 months, ruptured for 1 month." Two \nmonths ago, the patient\'s back collided with a fire hose and developed a local \nwalnut sized lump. The lump was soft, painless when pressed, and there was no \nobvious redness or swelling around it. The patient went to a private hospital \nfor incision and drainage treatment on their own. One month later, the condition \ndid not improve and there was yellow pus exuding from the incision site. For \nadditional diagnosis and treatment, the patient went to our hospital for \ntreatment.\nMETHODS: Back MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and abdominal ultrasound. Right \nback abscess incision and drainage surgery, pus pathogen examination: pus \nbacterial smear, bacterial culture, and identification. Auxiliary examinations: \nurine routine, blood routine, liver function, kidney function, blood lipids, and \nblood sugar.\nRESULTS: Back MR: Abnormal signal shadow of subcutaneous soft tissue in the \nlower back, suggesting inflammatory lesions with abscess formation. Acid fast \nstaining of pus: positive.

A saliva and nitrate-rinse sample were \ncollected from each participant to analyse salivary biomarkers and the activity \nand abundance of ONRB in vivo. Additionally, the effect of cigarette smoke on \nthe nitrate-reducing activity of four Rothia species was investigated in vitro.\nRESULTS: The beta diversity of the oral microbiome was significantly different \nbetween smokers and non-smokers (P = 0.0063). Neisseria flavescens and \nActinomyces oris were significantly higher in the saliva of smokers, however, \nNeisseria subflava, Neisseria oralis, Kingella denitrificans and Actinomyces \ngeorgiae were lower. Salivary nitrite levels were significantly lower in smokers \n(P = 0.034), along with a trend for decreased salivary pH (P = 0.058) and \nincreased salivary thiocyanate (P = 0.018). In vitro exposure to cigarette smoke \ndecreased the nitrate-reducing activity by Rothia species (P = 0.0046).\nCONCLUSIONS: Smoking decreased salivary nitrite levels and had a species \ndependent effect on ONRB abundance in vivo and inhibitory effect on the \nnitrate-reducing activity of Rothia species in vitro.\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A 'shift' in the oral microbiome and inhibitory effect on \nnitrate reduction in smokers may contribute to an increased risk of oral and \ncardiovascular disease. Better understanding of this pathway may have the \npotential for development of interventions to decrease disease risk in this \ngroup.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd..

However, limited data are \navailable on bloodstream infections caused by these bacteria in Europe. A \nmulticentre retrospective observational study was conducted over a 4-year period \n(2020-2023) across 44 European hospitals to analyze all anaerobes isolated from \nblood cultures. The study examined the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance \nprofiles of anaerobes identified in paediatric patients, comparing the findings \nwith those observed in adults. Among the 14,527 total anaerobic isolates, 186 \n(1.3%) were detected from paediatric patients. These were predominantly \nGram-positive (70%) and Gram-negative (22%) bacilli. The most prevalent species \nin paediatric patients were Cutibacterium acnes (24.7%), Schaalia odontolytica \n(9.7%), Actinomyces oris (8.1%), and Bacteroides fragilis (7.5%). Relative \nfeature importance based on the mean SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values \ndistinguished paediatric patients and adults based on their antibiotic \nresistance patterns with high accuracy. Compared to those from adult patients, \nGram-positive bacilli detected in paediatric samples displayed higher resistance \nrates for meropenem (15% vs. 9%), metronidazole (52% vs. 24%), and vancomycin \n(27% vs. 6%), and lower resistance to benzylpenicillin (11% vs. 17%), \namoxicillin/clavulanate (9% vs. 17%), and clindamycin (30% vs. 36%). \nGram-negative bacilli in paediatric samples displayed lower resistance to \nbenzylpenicillin (18% vs. 29%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26% vs. 33%), and \nclindamycin (20% vs. 27%), and they were highly susceptible to imipenem, \nmeropenem, and metronidazole as those detected in adult patients. Bacteroides \nspecies detected in paediatric and adult patients displayed high resistance to \npiperacillin/tazobactam (33% vs. 39%) and clindamycin (38% vs. 29%), while they \nwere highly susceptible to metronidazole. Compared to those from adult samples, \nCutibacterium acnes in paediatric patients displayed lower resistance to \nbenzylpenicillin (none vs. 15%) and clindamycin (17% vs. 29%). The comparison of \nspecies and susceptibility profiles of anaerobes detected in paediatric and \nadult patients highlighted the importance of reporting antimicrobial \nsusceptibility surveillance data by age group.\n\n© 2025.

Viability qPCR \naims to eliminate DNA from membrane-compromised cells through treatment with \npropidium monoazide (PMA). Here, we evaluated PMA-qPCR to enumerate viable cells \nof Actinomyces oris, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis, \nStreptococcus mutans, and Veillonella dispar. Five-species oral biofilms were \ngrown on hydroxyapatite discs for 64\xa0h. The biofilms were exposed to 0.2\xa0% \nchlorhexidine (CHX) or 3\xa0% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 2\xa0min, either once \nbefore cell harvest at 64\xa0h or six times during biofilm growth. The total and \nsingle species cells were quantified by culture (CFU) and qPCR from samples with \nand without PMA treatment before DNA extraction. For species-specific qPCR, \nTaqMan assays were applied. To determine total bacteria counts, a SYBR green \nqPCR was established using universal degenerative primers for the conserved dnaK \ngene. For biofilms treated once with CHX, the addition of PMA led to a 1 to 1.6 \nlog10 reduction in PCR counts. This closely matched CFU and PMA-qPCR counts for \ntotal bacteria and all single species, except for F. nucleatum, where PMA-qPCR \ndetected significantly more bacteria than culture. NaOCl treatment directly \naffected DNA and inhibited subsequent PCR amplification, even in samples without \nPMA. Single treatment of biofilms with 3\xa0% NaOCl and six-fold exposure of \nbiofilms to disinfectants resulted in no viable cell detection by culture. \nHowever, PMA did not completely prevent PCR amplification, indicating that \ndisinfectant efficacy measured by viability PCR could be underestimated.\n\n© 2025 The Authors.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.bioflm.2025.100281\nPMCID: PMC12051517\nPMID: 40330624\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no known \ncompeting financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared \nto influence the work reported in this paper.'},

Actinomyces causing endocarditis \nis extremely rare, with only one prior case of Actinomyces oris endocarditis \nreported in 2020 in Thailand. We present the first case ever reported in the \nUnited States.\nCASE DESCRIPTION: We present a 58-year-old African American woman with multiple \ncomorbidities, including end-stage renal disease, on hemodialysis who presented \nwith altered mentation. On investigations, she had A. oris bacteremia, with \nechocardiography revealing mitral valve vegetation.

Research on fusobacterial pathogenesis has \nmainly focused on the model strain ATCC 23726 from FNN. However, this narrow \nfocus may overlook significant behaviors of other FNN strains and those from \nother subspecies, given the genetic and phenotypic diversity within F. \nnucleatum. While ATCC 23726 is highly transformable, most other Fusobacterium \nstrains exhibit low transformation efficiency, complicating traditional gene \ndeletion methods that rely on non-replicating plasmids. To address this, we \ndeveloped a conditional plasmid system in which the RepA protein, essential for \nreplication of a pCWU6-based shuttle plasmid, is controlled by an inducible \nsystem combining an fdx promoter with a theophylline-responsive riboswitch. This \nsystem allows plasmid replication in host cells upon induction and plasmid loss \nwhen the inducer is removed, forcing chromosomal integration via homologous \nrecombination in the presence of the antibiotic thiamphenicol. We validated this \napproach by targeting the galK gene, successfully generating mutants in FNN \n(ATCC 23726, CTI-2), FNP (ATCC 10953), FNA (21_1A), and the closely related \nspecies Fusobacterium periodonticum. Incorporating a sacB counterselection \nmarker in this conditional plasmid enabled the deletion of the radD gene in \nnon-model strains. Interestingly, while radD deletion in 23726, 10953, and 21_1A \nabolished coaggregation with Actinomyces oris, the CTI-2 mutant retained this \nability, suggesting the involvement of other unknown adhesins. This work \nsignificantly advances gene deletion in genetically recalcitrant F. nucleatum \nstrains, enhancing our understanding of this pathogen.IMPORTANCEFusobacterium \nnucleatum is implicated in various human diseases, including periodontal \ndisease, preterm birth, and colorectal cancer, often linked to specific strains \nand reflecting the species' genetic and phenotypic diversity. Despite this \ndiversity, most genetic research has centered on the model strain ATCC 23726, \npotentially missing key aspects of other strains' pathogenic potential. This \nstudy addresses a critical gap by developing a novel conditional plasmid system \nthat enables gene deletion in genetically recalcitrant strains of F. nucleatum. \nWe successfully deleted genes in the FNN clinical strain CTI-2, the FNA strain \n21_1A, and F. periodonticum for the first time. Our findings, particularly the \nvarying behavior of the radD gene production in coaggregation across strains, \nunderscore the complexity of F. nucleatum and the need for broader genetic \nstudies. This work advances our understanding of F. nucleatum virulence at the \nstrain level and provides a valuable tool for future bacterial genetics \nresearch.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/aem.01816-24\nPMCID: PMC11837546\nPMID: 39853127 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest."}],

We previously reported that Bifidobacterium adolescentis levels \nwere reduced in the feces of patients with AAA by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid \n(RNA) gene sequencing. In this study, we increased the number of cases and \nconducted metagenomic analyses to examine bacterial genes associated with the \npathophysiology of AAA. Methods: For gut microbiota data, feces from 55 patients \nwith AAA and 52 patients with no history of AAA, lower extremity artery disease, \nor coronary artery disease (control group) were collected. Metagenomic analysis \nwas performed by collecting raw stool samples from patients. For intestinal \nmicrobiota analysis, metagenomic analysis of the fecal samples was performed. \nResults: Oral bacteria, including Actinomyces oris (p <0.0001), Streptococcus \nsalivarius (p <0.001), Lactobacillus salivarius (p <0.001), and Streptococcus \nsp.

In addition, \nbacterial genes related to alpha lipoic acid (ALA) biosynthesis (M00882, M00883, \nand M00884, p <0.0001) were decreased in patients with AAA. Conclusions: In the \nfeces of patients with AAA, there was an increase in oral bacteria, and the \nexpression of bacterial genes related to ALA biosynthesis was reduced.

In Actinomyces oris, the pilus-specific sortase SrtC2 not \nonly polymerizes FimA pilins to assemble type 2 fimbriae with CafA at the tip, \nbut it can also act as the anchoring sortase, linking both FimA polymers and \nSrtC1-catalyzed FimP polymers (type 1 fimbriae) to peptidoglycan when the \nhousekeeping sortase SrtA is inactive. To date, the structure-function \ndeterminants governing the unique substrate specificity and dual enzymatic \nactivity of SrtC2 have not been illuminated. Here, we present the crystal \nstructure of SrtC2 solved to 2.10-Å resolution. SrtC2 harbors a canonical \nsortase fold and a lid typical for class C sortases and additional features \nspecific to SrtC2. Structural, biochemical, and mutational analyses of SrtC2 \nreveal that the extended lid of SrtC2 modulates its dual activity. Specifically, \nwe demonstrate that the polymerizing activity of SrtC2 is still maintained by \nalanine-substitution, partial deletion, and replacement of the SrtC2 lid with \nthe SrtC1 lid. Strikingly, pilus incorporation of CafA is significantly reduced \nby these mutations, leading to compromised polymicrobial interactions mediated \nby CafA. In a srtA mutant, the partial deletion of the SrtC2 lid reduces surface \nanchoring of FimP polymers, and the lid-swapping mutation enhances this process, \nwhile both mutations diminish surface anchoring of FimA pili. Evidently, the \nextended lid of SrtC2 enables the enzyme the cell wall-anchoring activity in a \nsubstrate-selective fashion.\n\nCopyright © 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we \nestablished a controlled mixed-species in vitro biofilm model and used it to \nassess the impact of glucose and lactate on the ability of Streptococcus mutans, \nan acidogenic and aciduric species, to compete with commensal oral bacteria. A \nchemically defined medium was developed that supported the growth of S. mutans \nand four common early colonizers of dental plaque: Streptococcus gordonii, \nActinomyces oris, Neisseria subflava, and Veillonella parvula. Biofilms \ncontaining the early colonizers were developed in a continuous flow bioreactor, \nexposed to S. mutans, and incubated for up to 7 days. The abundance of bacteria \nwas estimated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). At high glucose \nand high lactate, the pH in bulk fluid rapidly decreased to approximately 5.2, \nand S. mutans outgrew other species in biofilms. In low glucose and high \nlactate, the pH remained above 5.5, and V. parvula was the most abundant species \nin biofilms. By contrast, in low glucose and low lactate, the pH remained above \n6.0 throughout the experiment, and the microbial community in biofilms was \nrelatively balanced. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed that all \nspecies were present in the biofilm and the majority of cells were viable using \nlive/dead staining. These data demonstrate that carbon source concentration is \ncritical for microbial homeostasis in model oral biofilms. Furthermore, we \nestablished an experimental system that can support the development of \ncomputational models to predict transitions to microbial dysbiosis based on \nmetabolic interactions.IMPORTANCEWe developed a controlled (by removing host \nfactor) dynamic system metabolically representative of early colonization of \nStreptococcus mutans not measurable in vivo. Hypotheses on factors influencing \nS. mutans colonization, such as community composition and inoculation sequence \nand the effect of metabolite concentrations, can be tested and used to predict \nthe effect of interventions such as dietary modifications or the use of \ntoothpaste or mouthwash on S. mutans colonization.

The performance of established test \nmethods was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.\nRESULTS: The calculated synovial fluid percentage of polymorphonuclear \nneutrophils (SF-%PMN) cut-off of > 67% demonstrated the best preoperative \nperformance with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), \nnegative predictive value (NPV), and area under the curve (AUC) of 97.1% (95% CI \n83.9 to 100), 97.2% (95% CI 91.9 to 100), 97.1% (95% CI 91.6 to 100), 97.2% (95% \nCI 91.9 to 100), and 0.972 (95% CI 0.933 to 1.000), followed by SF white blood \ncell count (SF-WBC) > 2,403 cells/µl with estimates of 85.4% (95% CI 71.1 to \n93.4), 100% (95% CI 94.6 to 100), 100% (100), 93.3% (95% CI 88.0 to 98.5), and \n0.927 (95% CI 0.872 to 0.982). While a %PMN cut-off of > 67% outperformed the \nestablished threshold of > 80% (p = 0.010), the calculated SF-WBC cut-off of > \n2,403 G/l did not perform significantly better than the established threshold of \n> 3,000 G/l (p = 0.266). Intraoperatively, permanent paraffin-fixed sections \nshowed the best accuracy with performance values of 89.3% (95% CI 78.1 to 95.3), \n100% (95% CI 97.7 to 100), 100% (100), 97.1% (95% CI 94.8 to 99.4), and 0.946 \n(95% CI 0.906 to 0.987), followed by frozen sections (85.7% (95% CI 67.7 to \n94.6), 99.2% (95% CI 95.1 to 100), 95.8% (95% CI 87.8 to 100), 96.9% (95% CI \n94.0 to 99.9), and 0.922 (95% CI 0.853 to 0.991)).\nCONCLUSION: Synovial fluid %PMN and WBC, and permanent histological sections \ndemonstrated the highest diagnostic performance for diagnosing PJI caused by \nlow-virulence pathogens. Intraoperative frozen sections proved to be a valuable \nintraoperative tool, particularly in cases with unclear preoperative diagnosis. \nA lower cut-off for SF-%PMN may be considered to more accurately diagnose these \ninfections.\n\n© 2025 Luger et al.\n\nDOI: 10.1302/2046-3758.1412.BJR-2025-0236.R1\nPMCID: PMC12683604\nPMID: 41355801\n\nConflict of interest statement: M.

The influence of pet exposure on the pediatric ocular surface \nmicrobiome (OSM), a potential mediator of ocular immunity, remains \nuncharacterized. This study investigates OSM alterations in children with \nhousehold pet contact.\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional study, conjunctival swabs from 347 children \n(aged 5-15 years) in the CUHK Hong Kong Children Eye Study were analyzed. 16S \nrRNA sequencing (V3-V4 region) was performed, followed by bioinformatic analysis \n(QIIME2, DADA2, SILVA 138) and functional prediction (PICRUSt2). Alpha/beta \ndiversity, taxonomic composition, and KEGG pathways were compared.\nRESULTS: Pet-exposed children had higher alpha diversity \n(Shannon/Simpson/Observed indexes; P < 0.05) with positive dose-response to \ncontact time. Compositionally, these children showed distinct beta diversity \n(Bray-Curtis Distance, P = 0.015) and enriched genera (Streptococcus, \nActinomyces, Neisseria; LDA Score > 2.0). NF-κB signaling and VEGF signaling \nwere predicted to enrich in pet-exposed children while non-exposed children \nshowed increased macrolide biosynthesis pathways.\nCONCLUSION: Pet exposure associates with increased diversity, enrichment of taxa \nassociated with animals and the environment, and NF-κB/VEGF pathway activation \nin the pediatric OSM. This suggests OSM as a novel mechanism for pet-related \nimmune modulation, potentially influencing ocular surface health and allergy \nsusceptibility.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.crmicr.2025.100518\nPMCID: PMC12681768\nPMID: 41362316\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no known \ncompeting financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared \nto influence the work reported in this paper.'},

Despite its economic significance, the influence of the abomasal parasite \nO. ostertagi on the rumen microbiome remains unexplored. We examined the effects \nof subclinical O. ostertagi infection and vaccination on the rumen microbiome at \ntaxonomic and functional levels. In an experimental trial, calves treated with \nvaccine or adjuvant-only were orally challenged with O. ostertagi larvae daily \nfor 25 days; 4 groups of animals (UNF: unvaccinated, unchallenged; VAC: \nvaccinated, challenged; CHE: unvaccinated, challenged, high cumulative faecal \negg counts (cFEC), and CLE: unvaccinated, challenged, low cFEC) were selected \nfor whole shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Using a rigorous permutation test \nbased on partial least squares discriminant analyses, we identified 36 (91), 38 \n(31), 21 (57), 41 (64) and 29 (57) microbial genera (genes) that distinguished \nVAC, CHE and CLE from UNF, CHE from CLE, and CHE from VAC, respectively. The \nsubclinical infection reshaped the rumen microbiome; enrichment of opportunistic \npathogens such as Listeria, and depletion of Filifactor in infected animals were \nidentified as potential biomarkers for host immune response, whereas Actinomyces \nand Microspora were potential biomarkers of resistance to infection. Microbial \nbiochemical pathways like acetogenesis (e.g., Elusimicrobium, nrfA), pectin and \nhemicellulose degradation (e.g., Sphaerochaeta), and phosphorus and sulphur \nmetabolism (e.g., Candidatus Accumulibacter and Desulfatibacillum) were also \naffected by parasitism. Both infection and vaccination altered methanogens, \nmethanotrophs and the methane metabolism pathway, highlighted by distinct gene \nclustering patterns between infected and uninfected animals. Clustering patterns \nof infected and vaccinated animals exhibited some similarities, which may \nreflect immune system modulation of the ruminal microbiome as a result of an \nabomasal infection. This study unveils critical changes in the rumen microbiome \ndue to the infection by and vaccination against the abomasal parasite O. \nostertagi.

Previous studies \nsuggest covarying relationships between circulating and salivary metabolites in \npatients with T2D. However, the role of hyperglycemia-induced saccharide \nmigration from plasma to saliva in caries pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we \ndeveloped a novel method for untargeted metabolomics profiling of trace saliva \nfrom sublingual and submandibular glands, comparing this profile with those of \nplasma and whole saliva in participants with T2D (n\u2009=\u200931) and those with \nnormoglycemia (n\u2009=\u200930). This comparison aimed to determine how circulating \nsaccharide migration into the oral cavity and its subsequent microbial \nconsumption are linked to dental caries. Additionally, shotgun metagenomic \nsequencing was combined with this analysis to investigate the cariogenic impact \nof circulating saccharide migration on the composition and function of \nsupragingival biofilm using MetaPhlAn4 and HUMAnN3 pipelines.\nRESULTS: The metabolomics profiles of glandular saliva showed intermediate \ndissimilarity between plasma and whole saliva, reflecting cardiometabolic traits \nmore sensitively than whole saliva. Glucose and fructose showed a decreasing \npositive correlation with glycemic parameters in the order of plasma, glandular \nsaliva, and whole saliva, suggesting systemic-to-oral migration and subsequent \nmicrobial consumption. Saccharide migration was more pronounced in participants \nwith dental caries and plaque accumulation, coinciding with shifts in \nsupragingival microbiota, including depletion of Streptococcus sanguinis, \nCorynebacterium durum, and Rothia aeria, and enrichment of Streptococcus mutans, \nVeillonella parvula, and Actinomyces sp. oral taxon 448. Glycolytic potential \nincreased at the community level. Improved glycemic control reduced fructose \nmigration and mitigated dysbiosis, decreasing fructose phosphotransferase \nabundance and shifting the S. mutans-S. sanguinis balance. Experimental \nvalidation demonstrated that fructose promotes S. mutans dominance over S. \nsanguinis in dual-species biofilms.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study establishes saccharide migration as a metabolic driver \nof supragingival dysbiosis in T2D. The findings highlight the role of both \nglucose and fructose in caries pathogenesis and suggest that glycemic control \ncould serve as an effective strategy as part of caries control.

However, controlling these nematodes is \nchallenging\xa0because a limited number of chemical pesticides and biocontrol \nagents are effective against them. Here, we demonstrate that pepper rotation \nmarkedly reduces Meloidogyne incognita infection in cucumber and diminishes the \npresence of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in the soil, a compound known to exacerbate \nM.\xa0incognita infection. Pepper rotation also restructures the rhizobacterial \ncommunity, leading to the colonization of the cucumber rhizosphere by two \nPseudarthrobacter oxydans strains (RH60 and RH97), facilitated by enrichment of \npalmitic acid in pepper root exudates. Both strains exhibit high nematocidal \nactivity against M.\xa0incognita\xa0and have the ability to biosynthesize indoleacetic \nacid and biodegrade p-hydroxybenzoic acid. RH60 and RH97 also induce systemic \nresistance in cucumber plants and promote their growth.

Kaolin mining had an \nimpact on the recruitment of three rhizosphere bacteria native to the area: \nActinoplanes, RB41, and Mycobacterium. These bacteria were found to be more \nabundant in the rhizosphere soil of three local plants than in bulk soil, yet \nthe mining of kaolin caused a decrease in their abundance (p\u2009<\u20090.05). \nInterestingly, Ralstonia was enriched in the rhizosphere of these plants found \nin kaolin mining areas, suggesting its resilience to environmental stress. \nFurthermore, the three plants had different dominant rhizosphere bacterial \npopulations in kaolin mining areas, such as Nocardioides, Pseudarthrobacter, and \nSphingomonas, likely due to the unique microecology of the plant rhizosphere. \nKaolin mining activities also caused a shift in the functional diversity of \nrhizosphere bacteria in the three local plants, with each plant displaying \ndifferent functions to cope with kaolin mining-induced stress, such as increased \nabundance of the GlpM family and glucan-binding domain.\nDISCUSSION: This study is the first to investigate the effects of kaolin mining \non the rhizosphere microecology of local plants, thus contributing to the \nestablishment of soil microecological health monitoring indicators to better \ncontrol soil pollution in kaolin mining areas.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Gao, Chen, He, Sha, Ren, Wu and Li.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2024.1424687\nPMCID: PMC11417686\nPMID: 39314884\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

We recently demonstrated that the phyllosphere (leaf \nsurface) bacterial community structure changed when squash (Cucurbita pepo) was \ngrown with a rye (Secale cereale) cover crop treatment, followed by a decrease \nof angular leaf spot disease symptoms on squash caused by P. syringae \npv.\xa0lachrymans. Application of biocontrol agents is a known agricultural \npractice to mitigate crop losses due to microbial disease. In this study, we \ntested the hypothesis that some phyllosphere bacteria promoted when squash is \ngrown on cover crops could be isolated and used as a biocontrol agent to \ndecrease angular leaf spot symptoms. We grew squash during a 2-year field \nexperiment using four agricultural practices: bare soil, cover crops, chemically \nterminated cover crops, and plastic cover. We sampled squash leaves at three \ndifferent dates each year and constructed a collection of cultivable bacterial \nstrains isolated from squash leaves and rye cover crop material. Each isolated \nstrain was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and used in in vitro (Petri \ndish) pathogen growth and in vivo (greenhouse) symptom control assays. Four \nbacterial isolates belonging to the genera Pseudarthrobacter, Pseudomonas, \nDelftia, and Rhizobium were shown to inhibit P. syringae pv. lachrymans growth \nand angular leaf spot symptom development. Strikingly, the symptom control \nefficacy of all strains was stronger on older leaves. This study sheds light on \nthe importance of bacterial isolation from cover crop sources to promote disease \ncontrol. [Formula: see text] Copyright © 2024 The Author(s).

Their \neasy isolation and growth procedures make bacterial endophytes an untapped \nsource of novel drugs, which might help to face the problem of antimicrobial \nresistance. This study investigates the antagonistic potential of endophytic \nbacteria isolated from different compartments of the medicinal plant O. \nheracleoticum against human opportunistic pathogens.\nMETHODS: A panel of endophytes was employed in cross-streaking tests against \nmultidrug-resistant human pathogens, followed by high-resolution chemical \nprofiling using headspace-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.\nRESULTS: Endophytic bacteria exhibited the ability to antagonize the growth of \nopportunistic pathogens belonging to the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). The \ndifferent inhibition patterns observed were related to their taxonomic \nattribution at the genus level; most active strains belong to the Gram-positive \ngenera Bacillus, Arthrobacter, and Pseudarthrobacter. Bcc strains of clinical \norigin were more sensitive than environmental strains. Cross-streaking tests \nagainst other 36 human multidrug-resistant pathogens revealed the highest \nantimicrobial activity towards the Coagulase-negative staphylococci and \nKlebsiella pneumoniae strains. Interestingly, strains of human origin were the \nmost inhibited, in both groups. Concerning the production of volatile organic \ncompounds (VOCs), the strain Arthrobacter sp. OHL24 was the best producer of \nsuch compounds, while two Priestia strains were good ketones producers and so \ncould be considered for further biotechnological applications.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study highlights the diverse antagonistic activities \nof O. heracleoticum-associated endophytes against both Bcc and \nmultidrug-resistant (MDR) human pathogens.

However, little is known about \nhow these effects persist or change after slaughter, particularly in shaping the \ncarcass microbiota. This study investigated the occurrence and enumeration of \nCampylobacter, the overall bacterial community structure in carcasses from \nconventional and free-range broilers, and the influence of slaughter batch \ntiming (early versus late) on contamination and microbiota composition. A total \nof 314 post-chilling carcass samples were analyzed: 160 from conventional and \n154 from free-range production systems, each obtained from two slaughterhouses \nspecialized in their respective production methods. On each sampling day, half \nof the carcasses were collected from the first slaughtered batches, and the \nother half from the last. Campylobacter occurrence was higher in free-range \ncarcasses (96.2 %) than in conventional ones (75 %), although mean counts were \ngreater in conventional carcasses (1.8 log₁₀ CFU/ml) compared with free-range \ncarcasses (1.3 log₁₀ CFU/ml). The timing of slaughter batches did not \nsignificantly affect Campylobacter contamination levels. Sparse Partial Least \nSquares-Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) revealed a clear separation between the \ncarcass microbiota of conventional and free-range broilers. Conventional \ncarcasses were enriched in common gut- and processing-related genera, including \nAliarcobacter, Lactococcus, and Pseudarthrobacter. Free-range carcasses \ndisplayed higher abundances of gut-associated taxa, including Lysinibacillus, \nComamonas, and Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group, as well as genera not typically \nassociated with the broiler gut or processing environments (Ureibacillus, \nPedobacter, Pseudoxanthomonas). Within conventional systems, early batches were \ndominated by bacteria typical of processing environments (Aliarcobacter, \nChryseobacterium, Flavobacterium). In contrast, later batches showed increased \nabundances of gut-associated and spoilage genera (Clostridium, Bacillus, \nRomboutsia, Moraxella). In free-range carcasses, later batches showed a higher \nabundance of the thermotolerant and biofilm-forming Anoxybacillus. Overall, \nthese findings highlight distinct microbial signatures and Campylobacter \ncontamination patterns between production systems and emphasize that \nslaughter-related factors, particularly processing time, further shape carcass \nmicrobiota composition.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

Through controlled \nlaboratory incubation experiments, a comprehensive approach combining soil \nphysicochemical property analysis, earthworm biochemical assays, pesticide \nresidue monitoring, and microbial community sequencing was employed to \nsystematically assess the effects of microplastic type and concentration on \npesticide degradation pathways, earthworm antioxidant responses, and bacterial \ncommunity structure. The results demonstrated that a high concentration of PLA \n(1\xa0% w/w) significantly enhanced the degradation rate of dimethomorph by 6.75\xa0% \nand increased the accumulation of its Z-isomer in earthworms by 76.4\xa0% compared \nto the control. Concurrently, PLA at 1\xa0% elevated the accumulation of the \nmetolachlor metabolite MOA by 33.29\xa0% in soil and 82.5\xa0% in earthworms, and \ninduced oxidative stress in earthworms (e.g., a significant increase of \napproximately 50\xa0% in MDA content) alongside intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. In \ncontrast, PE exhibited relatively minor effects. Soils amended with PLA showed a \nnotable enrichment of pesticide-degrading bacterial genera, such as \nPseudarthrobacter and Rhodococcus, with relative abundances increased by 103\xa0% \nand 65.4\xa0%, respectively, and significant correlations were identified among \nenvironmental factors, earthworm physiological indices, and pesticide \ndegradation rates.

High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were \nemployed to evaluate the rhizosphere microbiome, and redundancy analysis was \nutilized to investigate the relationship between the microbial communities and \nsoil nutrient indicators.\nRESULTS: TM2 and TM3 increased soil bacterial community diversity, reduced \nfungal community diversity, elevated the relative abundance of beneficial \nbacterial genera, and reduced the abundance of detrimental fungal genera in the \nrhizosphere soil. The relative abundance of Pseudarthrobacter, \nunclassified_Steroidobacteraceae, and Nocardioides in TM2 and TM3 was markedly \nhigher than in TM1. Conversely, the relative abundance of Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, \nCeratobasidium, and Plectosphaerella in TM2 and TM3 was significantly reduced \ncompared to TM1. The contents of available potassium (AK), total nitrogen (TN), \ntotal phosphorus (TP), and pH in the rhizosphere soil of TM2 and TM3 were \nsignificantly higher than those in TM1. The distribution of soil bacterial \ngenera was significantly influenced by the contents of TN and AK, while the \ndistribution of soil fungal genera was significantly or extremely significantly \nimpacted by the contents of TP, total potassium (TK), soil organic matter (SOM), \nand pH.

Electronic address: sunyang01@caas.cn.\n\nThis study investigated the effects of conventional polyethylene (PE) and \nbiodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) microplastics on the degradation behavior \nand ecological impacts of three commonly used pesticides-dimethomorph, \nmetolachlor, and imidacloprid-in a soil-earthworm system. Through controlled \nlaboratory incubation experiments, a comprehensive approach combining soil \nphysicochemical property analysis, earthworm biochemical assays, pesticide \nresidue monitoring, and microbial community sequencing was employed to \nsystematically assess the effects of microplastic type and concentration on \npesticide degradation pathways, earthworm antioxidant responses, and bacterial \ncommunity structure. The results demonstrated that a high concentration of PLA \n(1\xa0% w/w) significantly enhanced the degradation rate of dimethomorph by 6.75\xa0% \nand increased the accumulation of its Z-isomer in earthworms by 76.4\xa0% compared \nto the control. Concurrently, PLA at 1\xa0% elevated the accumulation of the \nmetolachlor metabolite MOA by 33.29\xa0% in soil and 82.5\xa0% in earthworms, and \ninduced oxidative stress in earthworms (e.g., a significant increase of \napproximately 50\xa0% in MDA content) alongside intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. In \ncontrast, PE exhibited relatively minor effects. Soils amended with PLA showed a \nnotable enrichment of pesticide-degrading bacterial genera, such as \nPseudarthrobacter and Rhodococcus, with relative abundances increased by 103\xa0% \nand 65.4\xa0%, respectively, and significant correlations were identified among \nenvironmental factors, earthworm physiological indices, and pesticide \ndegradation rates. In conclusion, while biodegradable PLA microplastics can \npromote the transformation of certain pesticides, they may also increase \necological risks by disrupting bacterial communities and affecting earthworm \nhealth. This highlights the importance of conducting a comprehensive evaluation \nof their environmental safety.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

A two-step mediation analysis identified microbiota \npotentially mediating the immune-gout relationship. Causal inference was \nprimarily conducted using inverse-variance weighting (IVW), with MR-Egger, \nsimple mode, weighted median, and weighted mode methods used to ensure \nrobustness. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed the reliability of the \nfindings.\nRESULTS: Eight immune cell phenotypes were significantly linked to gout-five \nprotective and three risk-related. Twenty gut microbial taxa were also \nassociated, including seven protective and thirteen risk-related. Mediation \nanalysis identified five microbial taxa (three genera, two species) mediating \nimmune cell effects on gout. For example, higher TD CD8br %CD8br cells reduced \ngout risk by lowering Microvirga abundance (β = - 0.0315, P = 0.045), mediating \n26.5%. In contrast, increased CD127 expression on CD28.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a potential causal link between immune cells and \ngut microbiota in gout and identifies key microbial taxa involved. The findings \ndeepen our understanding of gout pathogenesis and provide a basis for new \ntherapeutic approaches. Key Points • Employed the authoritative FinnGen R12 \ndisease database. • Utilized the latest gut microbiota GWAS data covering 473 \nmicrobial features. • Proposed a novel "immune cells-gut microbiota-gout" causal \npathway. • Integrated multi-omics approaches for systematic mediation analysis.\n\n© 2025.

However, airborne bacteria and \nantibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs), which are important biological components of \nPM2.5, have received less attention. In this study, we investigated the combined \neffects of haze on airborne bacteria and ARGs in PM2.5. Overall, during haze \ndays, high concentrations of airborne bacteria (haze: \n4782.24\xa0±\xa02689.85\xa0cells/m3; non-haze: 2866.00\xa0±\xa01753.95\xa0cells/m3) were observed \nwith unique bacterial community structures. At the genus level, Microvirga, \nArthrobacter, and JG30-KF-CM45 were identified as the bacterial biomarkers of \nhaze days. Neutral processes contributed more to the establishment of airborne \nbacterial communities on haze days (R2\xa0=\xa00.724) than that on non-hazy days \n(R2\xa0=\xa00.338). The pathogenicity of bacterial communities per unit volume of air \nwas significantly higher during haze days (169.36\xa0±\xa08.36\xa0cell/m3) than that \nduring non-haze days (112.66\xa0±\xa05.92\xa0cell/m3) (p\xa0<\xa00.05). Redundancy analysis \nindicated that relatively stable atmospheric conditions and high concentrations \nof water-soluble ions (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and F-), metals (Cd, As, Mn, and Cr), \nand carbonaceous fractions (elemental carbon) in PM2.5 play critical roles in \nshaping the bacterial community during haze days. On haze days, airborne ARGs \nexhibited unique distribution characteristics and network structures with \ndominant bacteria. This study highlighted the impact of haze days on airborne \nbacteria and ARGs on PM2.5 and provides a reference for managing the risks of \nbioaerosols.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

However, in recent \ndecades, it has been more and more difficult to obtain new phylotypes of the \ngenus Streptomyces by using conventional samples and culture strategies. In this \nstudy, we combined culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches to \nbetter explore the Streptomyces communities in desert sandy soils. Moreover, two \ndifferent culture strategies termed Conventional Culture Procedure (CCP) and \nStreptomycetes Culture Procedure (SCP) were employed to evaluate the isolation \nefficiency of Streptomyces spp. with different intensities of selectivity. The \n16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis revealed a very low abundance (0.04-0.37%, \naverage 0.22%) of Streptomyces in all the desert samples, conversely the \npercentage of Streptomyces spp. obtained by the culture-dependent method was \nvery high (5.20-39.57%, average 27.76%), especially in the rhizospheric sand \nsoils (38.40-39.57%, average 38.99%). Meanwhile, a total of 1589 pure cultures \nwere isolated successfully, dominated by Streptomyces (29.52%), Microvirga \n(8.06%) and Bacillus (7.68%). In addition, 400 potential new species were \nobtained, 48 of which belonged to the genus Streptomyces. More importantly, our \nstudy demonstrated the SCP strategy which had highly selectivity could greatly \nexpand the number and phylotypes of Streptomyces spp. by almost 4-fold than CCP \nstrategy. These results provide insights on the diversity investigation of \ndesert Streptomyces, and it could be reference for researchers to bring more \nnovel actinobacteria strains from the environment into culture.\n\nCopyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

While the rhizosphere microbiome is regarded as the second \ngenome of plants, how the indica and japonica rice rhizosphere microbial \ncommunities respond to deficit irrigation and their relationship with yield \nremain to be elucidated. Here, we conducted field experiments using 12 indica \nand 12 japonica rice varieties under full and deficit irrigation regimes. \nYield-related traits, including filled grain number, seed setting rate, \ntwo-plant yield, and thousand grain weight, were measured, and the rhizosphere \nmicrobial communities were characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In line \nwith previous studies, japonica varieties showed superior drought resistance in \nterms of yield performance. Both rice genotype and irrigation regime \nsignificantly influenced the composition and functional potential of the \nrhizosphere microbiome. Compared to indica rice, the japonica rice rhizosphere \nwas enriched with more beneficial microorganisms. Enrichment of \nnitrogen‑metabolism‑related groups, such as Microvirga and Nitrososphaeraceae, \nmay contribute to rhizosphere nitrogen cycling and support nitrogen availability \nfor the rice.

A two-step mediation analysis identified microbiota \npotentially mediating the immune-gout relationship. Causal inference was \nprimarily conducted using inverse-variance weighting (IVW), with MR-Egger, \nsimple mode, weighted median, and weighted mode methods used to ensure \nrobustness. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed the reliability of the \nfindings.\nRESULTS: Eight immune cell phenotypes were significantly linked to gout-five \nprotective and three risk-related. Twenty gut microbial taxa were also \nassociated, including seven protective and thirteen risk-related. Mediation \nanalysis identified five microbial taxa (three genera, two species) mediating \nimmune cell effects on gout. For example, higher TD CD8br %CD8br cells reduced \ngout risk by lowering Microvirga abundance (β = - 0.0315, P = 0.045), mediating \n26.5%. In contrast, increased CD127 expression on CD28.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a potential causal link between immune cells and \ngut microbiota in gout and identifies key microbial taxa involved. The findings \ndeepen our understanding of gout pathogenesis and provide a basis for new \ntherapeutic approaches. Key Points • Employed the authoritative FinnGen R12 \ndisease database. • Utilized the latest gut microbiota GWAS data covering 473 \nmicrobial features. • Proposed a novel "immune cells-gut microbiota-gout" causal \npathway. • Integrated multi-omics approaches for systematic mediation analysis.\n\n© 2025.

This study optimized machine learning models to \npredict the distribution of dominant bacterial genera across Australia on a \ncomprehensive dataset of 1971 topsoil samples. Our high-resolution digital maps \n(~1\u2009km resolution) reveal four distinct distribution patterns for the dominant \nbacterial genera: coastal or inland enriched patterns and latitude-related \npatterns. Each genus exhibited unique responses to critical factors, including \ntemperature, precipitation, soil organic carbon (SOC), and pH. Notably, our \nfindings highlight the importance of genus-level analysis, as bacterial genera \nwithin the same phylum can respond markedly differently to pedo-climatic \nconditions. Intensive land use significantly homogenized bacteria composition \nand increased the relative abundance of Rubrobacter, RB41, Microvirga, and \nSphingomonas.

The biogenic NPs also known as \nmagnetosomes have great importance in biomedical sciences for application such \nas magnetic hyperthermia, MRI, and targeted drug delivery. However, the issue \nlies in the obtaining an axenic culture of MTB and magnetosomes. To overcome \nthis issue, attempts were made to develop an MTB consortium and extract biogenic \nNPs for further use in magnetic hyperthermia. The sediment samples were used to \ndevelop an MTB consortium. The extracted NPs were characterized based on their \nmagnetic properties such as Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), Fourier \nTransform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy \nDispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDAX), and Transmission Electron Microscopy \n(TEM) with size of 40.44\xa0nm. The analysis of 16\xa0S amplicon sequencing revealed \nthat the consortium had a high abundance of Bacillus, followed by Magnetococcus, \nMicrovirga, Elusimicrobium, and Desulfovibrio. An in vitro study of \ntissue-mimicking phantom for application in magnetic hyperthermia was carried \nout using different concentrations of magnetosomes (0.5-1.0\xa0mg/ml). Further, the \nnanotoxicity of magnetosomes was evaluated in in vivo model of nematode C. \nelegans. Different assays such as biodistribution assay to study iron uptake, \noxidative stress assay, pharyngeal pumping rate assay, and lyso-tracking were \nperformed to evaluate nanotoxicity.

However, intensive \ncultivation and unrecommended farmers' soil management practices negatively \naffect the soil microbial communities, and hence that of the soil health. Here, \nwe investigated the functional and taxonomic diversity of soil microorganisms on \nsix selected smallholder farmers that grow Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea) \nand dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in Limpopo Province, South Africa using \nmetagenomics and phenotypic profiles studies. Five soil samples, randomly \ncollected per farm and pooled into a single representative sample were used. \nMetagenomics raw read quality control, genome assembly and annotation were \nperformed on the KBase platform while the community level physiological profile \nanalysis was done using Biolog Ecoplates™.\nRESULTS: The results indicated that the soil microbial communities in Chosen \nGeneration farm had higher rates of carbon source utilization. Likewise, it \nshowed greater microbial abundance of varying taxonomy in which Actinobacteria, \nFirmicutes and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla while Bacillus, \nStreptomyces, Microvirga and Bradyrhizobium were the most represented genera.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study reports that soils from the six farms studied are \nenriched with genetically and physiologically diverse microorganisms that are \nresponsible for crop growth. While soil physico-chemical properties can be \nassociated with microbial diversity in this study, further studies on farming \npractices such as fertilizer and irrigation are recommended to further explore \ntheir possible effects on soil microbes.\n\n© 2025.

We aimed to study the cultivable \nActinomycetota community associated with a marine sponge from the Portuguese \ncoast, Hymeniacidon perlevis, and investigate the potential of the retrieved \nisolates to produce compounds with antimicrobial, anticancer and anti-obesity \nproperties.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The analysis of the 16S rRNA gene revealed 79 \nActinomycetota isolates affiliated with 12 genera-Brachybacterium, Dietzia, \nGlutamicibacter, Gordonia, Micrococcus, Micromonospora, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, \nPaenoartrhobacter, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, and Tsukamurella, most of which \naffiliated with the genus Streptomyces. The screening of antimicrobial activity \nrevealed 13 strains, all belonging to the Streptomyces genus, capable of \ninhibiting the growth of Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, or Staphylococcus \naureus. Forty-three extracts exhibited cytotoxic activity against at least one \ntested cell line (HepG2, HCT-116, and hCMEC-D3). Three extracts that were active \nagainst the two cancer cell lines tested, did not reduce the viability of the \nnon-cancer endothelial cell line, hCMEC-D3. One Gordonia strain exhibited \nanti-obesity activity, revealed by its ability to reduce the neutral lipids in \nzebrafish larvae. Mass spectrometry-based dereplication analysis of active \nextracts identified several compounds associated with known Actinomycetota \nnatural products. Nonetheless, five clusters contained metabolites that did not \nmatch any annotated natural products, suggesting they may represent new \nbioactive molecules.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work contributed to increase the knowledge on the diversity \nand bioactive potential of Actinomycetota associated with H. perlevis.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

However, the \nimpact of the composition and diversity of the intratumoral microbiome on the \nprognosis of patients undergoing surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma \n(HCC) remains incompletely understood. In this study, we revealed a high \nabundance of bacteria in the neoplastic tissues. The presence of bacterial \nlipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid was detected alongside tumor-associated \nimmune cells. By utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified a specific \nintratumoral microbiome signature that was highly predictive of the prognosis \nfor HCC patients who underwent surgical resection. Specifically, the presence of \nIntestinimonas, Brachybacterium, and Rothia were identified as independent risk \nfactors for the overall survival of HCC patients who underwent surgical \nresection.IMPORTANCEAlthough some studies have shown an abundance of bacteria in \nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), there is still limited understanding of the \ncomposition and diversity of the intratumoral microbiome that is favorable or \nadverse to the prognosis of HCC patients. Our results indicated that a greater \nabundance of bacteria could be observed in the neoplastic tissues than in \nnonneoplastic tissues. Bacterial cell wall components largely coincided with \ntumor-associated immune cells.

Here, we evaluated the \nplant growth promotion abilities of actinobacteria isolated from the tea \n(Camellia sinensis) rhizosphere of Darjeeling, India. 16\xa0S rRNA gene ribotyping \nof 28 isolates demonstrated the presence of nine different culturable \nactinobacterial genera. Assessment of the in vitro PGP traits revealed that \nMicrococcus sp. AB420 exhibited the highest level of phosphate solubilization \n(i.e., 445\u2009±\u20092.1\xa0µg/ml), whereas Kocuria sp. AB429 and Brachybacterium sp. AB440 \nshowed the highest level of siderophore (25.8\u2009±\u20090.1%) and IAA production \n(101.4\u2009±\u20090.5\xa0µg/ml), respectively. Biopriming of maize seeds with the individual \nactinobacterial isolate revealed statistically significant growth in the treated \nplants compared to controls. Among them, treatment with Paenarthrobacter sp. \nAB416 and Brachybacterium sp. AB439 exhibited the highest shoot and root length. \nBiopriming has also triggered significant enzymatic and non-enzymatic \nantioxidative defense reactions in maize seedlings both locally and \nsystematically, providing a critical insight into their possible role in the \nreduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) burden. To better understand the role \nof actinobacterial isolates in the modulation of plant defense, three selected \nactinobacterial isolates, AB426 (Brevibacterium sp.), AB427 (Streptomyces sp.), \nand AB440 (Brachybacterium sp.) were employed to evaluate the dynamics of \ninduced systemic resistance (ISR) in maize. The expression profile of five key \ngenes involved in SA and JA pathways revealed that bio-priming with \nactinobacteria (Brevibacterium sp. AB426 and Brachybacterium sp. AB440) \npreferably modulates the JA pathway rather than the SA pathway. The infection \nstudies in bio-primed maize plants resulted in a delay in disease progression by \nthe biotrophic pathogen Ustilago maydis in infected maize plants, suggesting the \npositive efficacy of bio-priming in aiding plants to cope with biotic stress. \nConclusively, this study unravels the intrinsic mechanisms of PGPR-mediated ISR \ndynamics in bio-primed plants, offering a futuristic application of these \nmicroorganisms in the agricultural fields as an eco-friendly alternative.\n\n© 2024.

We aimed to study the cultivable \nActinomycetota community associated with a marine sponge from the Portuguese \ncoast, Hymeniacidon perlevis, and investigate the potential of the retrieved \nisolates to produce compounds with antimicrobial, anticancer and anti-obesity \nproperties.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: The analysis of the 16S rRNA gene revealed 79 \nActinomycetota isolates affiliated with 12 genera-Brachybacterium, Dietzia, \nGlutamicibacter, Gordonia, Micrococcus, Micromonospora, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, \nPaenoartrhobacter, Rhodococcus, Streptomyces, and Tsukamurella, most of which \naffiliated with the genus Streptomyces. The screening of antimicrobial activity \nrevealed 13 strains, all belonging to the Streptomyces genus, capable of \ninhibiting the growth of Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, or Staphylococcus \naureus. Forty-three extracts exhibited cytotoxic activity against at least one \ntested cell line (HepG2, HCT-116, and hCMEC-D3). Three extracts that were active \nagainst the two cancer cell lines tested, did not reduce the viability of the \nnon-cancer endothelial cell line, hCMEC-D3. One Gordonia strain exhibited \nanti-obesity activity, revealed by its ability to reduce the neutral lipids in \nzebrafish larvae. Mass spectrometry-based dereplication analysis of active \nextracts identified several compounds associated with known Actinomycetota \nnatural products. Nonetheless, five clusters contained metabolites that did not \nmatch any annotated natural products, suggesting they may represent new \nbioactive molecules.\nCONCLUSIONS: This work contributed to increase the knowledge on the diversity \nand bioactive potential of Actinomycetota associated with H. perlevis.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

However, the \nimpact of the composition and diversity of the intratumoral microbiome on the \nprognosis of patients undergoing surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma \n(HCC) remains incompletely understood. In this study, we revealed a high \nabundance of bacteria in the neoplastic tissues.

By utilizing 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified a specific \nintratumoral microbiome signature that was highly predictive of the prognosis \nfor HCC patients who underwent surgical resection.

This study investigated the degradation \ncharacteristics and effect mechanisms of six estrogens (E1, 17α-E2, 17β-E2, E3, \n17α-EE2, and DES) during the aerobic composting of chicken manure. An orthogonal \ntest comprising four factors (aeration rate, calcium-magnesium-phosphorus \nfertilizer (Ca-Mg-P fertilizer), coconut shell biochar, initial moisture \ncontent) and three levels of aerobic composting was conducted over a 45-day \nperiod to monitor the changes in estrogens and basic parameters. The results \nindicated that the factors influencing the estrogen degradation rate ranked as: \ninitial moisture content (MC)\xa0>\xa0Ca-Mg-P fertilizer\xa0>\xa0aeration rate\xa0>\xa0coconut \nshell biochar. These factors significantly influenced the abundance of \nestrogen-degrading genera. Optimal composting conditions for estrogen \ndegradation were identified as the addition of 10% coconut shell biochar, \nmaintaining an initial moisture content of 60%, and using an aeration rate of \n0.08\xa0L\xa0min-1∙kg-1DM (dry matter), with an average degradation rate of 86.88% for \nthe six estrogens under these conditions. During the composting process under \nvarious treatments, five known estrogen-degrading genera were observed with high \nrelative abundance (max 31.08%), and the predominant genera were Staphylococcus \nand Brachybacterium for 17α-E2, 17β-E2, E3, 17α-EE2, and DES, and Pusillimonas \nfor E1. The composition of microbial community structure changed significantly, \nand the dominated environment factors effecting the composition and succession \nof these genera were carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) and MC. The research results \ncan provide both a theoretical basis and practical reference for the effective \ndegradation of estrogens during the composting of chicken manure.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings from \nhigh-throughput sequencing analysis revealed the presence of 11 bacterial genera \nin Xianju wheat paste, with relative abundances exceeding 1%. These genera \nincluded Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Brevibacterium, Lactobacillus, \nAllorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Enterobacteriaceae, Pantoea, \nBrachybacterium, Klebsiella, Escherichia-Shigella and Ochrobactrum. Furthermore, \nsix fungal genera were identified with relative abundances greater than 1%, \nspecifically Aspergillus, Zygosaccharomyces, Cutaneotrichosporon, Candida, \nMillerozyma and Rhizopus. The correlation analysis indicated a significant \nimpact of the microbial community and nutritional flavor on the second phase of \nfermentation in Xianju wheat paste. The predominant bacterium Bacillus in Xianju \nwheat paste facilitated the production of free amino acids, whereas \nStaphylococcus exhibited a negative correlation with free amino acid levels. The \nquantity of volatile compounds in Xianju wheat paste progressively increased \nduring fermentation, with the presence of typical aroma compounds \n4-vinyl-2-methoxyphenol significantly associated with Bacillus. This indicated \nBacillus notably enhanced the production of aromatic substances. Furthermore, a \nstrong correlation was observed between Staphylococcus and the 18 volatile \norganic compounds, highlighting their substantial contribution to these aroma \ncompounds.\nCONCLUSION: This research indicates that the presence of microbial communities \nsignificantly contributes to the development of the nutritional flavor profile \nin Xianju wheat paste. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.\n\n© 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/jsfa.13916\nPMID: 39299931 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'}],

However, comparative studies examining \nthe microbiome-aroma nexus across major cigar-producing regions remain limited.\nMETHODS: We integrated high-throughput metagenomic sequencing with volatile \norganic compound (VOC) profiling to investigate microbial community structure \nand aroma compounds in four Yunnan cigars and two Cuban cigars.\nRESULTS: Bacillus spp. was consistently dominant across all samples, while \nYunnan cigars exhibited higher microbial diversity. A total of 121 VOCs were \ndetected, with nicotine, ylangene, δ-elemene, (R,S)-anatabine, and phenethyl \nalcohol identified as key aroma components. Nicotine, accounting for 29.7-55.0% \nof total VOC content, was positively correlated with Enterobacter and \nEscherichia, and negatively with Corynebacterium and Brachybacterium. Ylangene \nshowed strong positive associations with Brachybacterium and Yaniella. After FDR \ncorrection, 26 differential VOCs were identified across cigar groups. KEGG \npathway analysis revealed functional enrichment in carbohydrate, amino acid, and \nlipid metabolism. Principal component analysis indicated that the aroma \ncomplexity of certain Yunnan cigars, particularly YX4, approached that of Cuban \ncigars.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate that region-specific fermentation \nmicrobiota are intricately linked to the production of key VOCs.

Additionally, 33 nonvolatile metabolites (e.g., \npelargonidin 3-O-glucoside, dihydroisorhamnetin, and puerarin) were \nsignificantly correlated with MT_RPT flavor (VIP\xa0>\xa01, |r|\xa0≥\xa00.8, P\xa0<\xa00.05) and \ninfluenced by key functional microbes, including Pantoea, Aspergillus, \nBrachybacterium, and Staphylococcus. By day 30, the infusion darkened, and \nsensory scores declined (81.4, P\xa0<\xa00.05), attributed to the dominance of \nBrevibacterium. This microbial shift reduced water-soluble pectin, free amino \nacids, and 11 metabolites while increasing TBs and theophylline (219.33\xa0mg/g and \n0.09\xa0mg/g, respectively). Therefore, TBs were identified as a crucial indicator \nof optimal fermentation. Moreover, redundancy analysis indicated that the tea \npile's central temperature, moisture content, and pH were essential fermentation \nparameters (P\xa0<\xa00.05). These findings deepen our understanding of MT_RPT flavor \ndevelopment mechanisms and provide valuable insights into precise fermentation \ncontrol.\n\n© 2025 The Authors.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.fochx.2025.102424\nPMCID: PMC12002954\nPMID: 40241696\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no known \ncompeting financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared \nto influence the work reported in this paper."},

CE patients \nreceived doxycycline (100\xa0mg twice daily for 14 days). Endometrial tissue was \ncollected 1 day before endometrial transformation and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene \nsequencing of the V3-V4 region using QIIME2. Clinical and microbiological \noutcomes were compared between the groups.\nRESULTS: The two groups showed no significant differences in age, body mass \nindex, endometrial thickness, number of embryos transferred, or transfer \nprotocol (p > 0.05). Infertility duration was significantly longer in the CE \ngroup (p < 0.05). Alpha-diversity analysis revealed lower microbial richness and \ndiversity in the CE group (p < 0.05). Firmicutes abundance was significantly \nreduced (p = 0.0214), whereas Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes were increased (p \n< 0.05). At the genus level, Lactobacillus remained dominant but was markedly \ndecreased in the CE group (p = 0.0157), while Ralstonia and Methylobacterium \nwere enriched (p < 0.05). The clinical pregnancy rate and biochemical pregnancy \nrate showed no significant differences between the groups (p > 0.05), but the \nlive birth rate was significantly lower in the CE group (p = 0.036).\nCONCLUSION: Despite histological resolution following doxycycline therapy, CE \npatients exhibited persistent dysbiosis characterized by decreased Lactobacillus \nand increased opportunistic taxa, which may impair endometrial receptivity and \npregnancy outcomes. These findings suggest that antibiotic therapy alone may not \nfully restore microbial balance in CE, warranting further investigation into \nmicrobiota-targeted interventions to improve reproductive success.\n\n© 2025 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

According to scientific data, microorganisms \ninhabiting the lower female genital tract may influence susceptibility to and \npersistence of human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as the development and \nprogression of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) toward cervical cancer \n(CC).\nMETHODS: The study included 67 patients with a histological diagnosis of \nlow-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and 85 patients with high-grade \nsquamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). The cervical canal microbiome of \npatients with LSIL (n = 31) and HSIL (n = 45) was examined using the 16S rRNA \ngene sequencing method, while the microbiocenosis of the remaining patients with \nLSIL (n = 36) and HSIL (n = 40) was analyzed using PCR-RT.\nRESULTS: There are patients with HSIL on average older than patients with LSIL \nabout 3 years. HPV 16 was found to be the most common virus type in patients \nwith SIL. When determining of 16S rRNA genes of prokaryotic microorganisms in \nwomen of reproductive age with SIL by the new generation sequencing, it turned \nout that the cervical canal microbiome is inhabited by many atypical \nrepresentatives (soil, aquatic and aerobacteria). In addition to the genera \nLactobacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Gardnerella, Ureaplasma, \nPrevotella, Sneathia, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, Megasphaera, Dialister, \nEnterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Fannyhessea, Peptococcus, \nPeptostreptococcus, Finegoldia, Porphyromonas, Corynebacterium, Alloscardovia, \nMageeibacillus, Haemophilus, Duncaniella, Ralstonia, Sphingomonas, Pedobacter, \nMethylobacterium, Ruminococcus, Sediminibacterium, Pseudomonas, Aerococcus, \nAcinetobacter, Campylobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Sphingobacterium, \nPhyllobacterium and others may be included in the microbial composition of the \ncervical canal. Dysbiotic disorders were more common in patients with HSIL. \nStreptococcus spp. always accompanied aerobic vaginitis (AV), whereas bacterial \nvaginosis (BV) was associated with the genera Gardnerella, Fannyhessea, \nPrevotella, Dialister, Sneathia, Anaerococcus, Megasphaera, Finegoldia, \nPeptoniphilus, Porphyromonas, Parvimonas and Eubacterium spp. When comparing the \ntwo methods, the genera Peptoniphilus, Methylobacterium, Ralstonia spp, \nSphingomonas, Phyllobacterium, Parvimonas, Anaerococcus and Ruminococcus may be \nincluded in the microbial biomass in a significant proportion. Eubacterium spp. \ndid not occur in the 16S sequencing method.

To date, no studies have directly examined the nasal mucosal \nmicrobiota in MS. This study aimed to explore potential relationships among \nolfactory function, nasal microbiota composition, and superior turbinate volume \nin MS.\nMETHODS: This single-center observational study included 42 patients with MS and \n37 healthy controls (HC) in China. Olfactory function was evaluated using the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Deep nasal \nmicrobiota profiles and MRI-based measurements of superior turbinate volume were \nanalyzed.\nRESULTS: A reduced relative abundance of Prevotella buccalis (P. buccalis) was \nobserved in MS with lower UPSIT scores (p\u2009=\u20090.030). In HC, a positive \ncorrelation was found between UPSIT scores and the superior turbinate volume \n(Rp\u2009=\u20090.329, p\u2009=\u20090.041), whereas no such correlation was observed in MS \n(Rs\u2009=\u2009-0.022, p\u2009=\u20090.625), suggesting a dissociation between olfactory \nperformance and turbinate morphology in MS. Additionally, in MS, superior \nturbinate volume showed negative correlations with several genera, including \nCupriavidus, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, Ideonella, and Acinetobacter (all \np\u2009<\u20090.05), indicating potential associations between mucosal structure and \nmicrobial composition.\nDISCUSSION: These preliminary findings suggest that alterations in nasal \nmicrobiota may be linked to olfactory impairment and mucosal structural changes \nin MS. While P. buccalis emerged as a potential microbial correlate of olfactory \ndysfunction, its role remains unclear and may reflect secondary ecological \nshifts. Further mechanistic studies and larger cohorts are needed to determine \ncausality and assess the diagnostic or therapeutic value of nasal microbiome \nfeatures in MS.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Currently, studies have examined EGT \nimport systems and its physiological roles in various organisms. Despite the \nbroad applicability of EGT, industrial production with high productivity has not \nyet been achieved. In this study, we aimed to develop fermentative production \nmethods for EGT using Corynebacterium glutamicum as a host and successfully \nachieved the highest yield of EGT (459 mg L-1) reported to date. A \ncysteine-producing strain C. glutamicum CYS-2, which was constructed in a \nprevious study, was engineered to enhance the biosynthesis of histidine and \nS-adenosylmethionine, both of which, along with cysteine, are required for EGT \nproduction. Additionally, heterologous metabolic pathways for EGT biosynthesis \nfrom Mycolicibacterium smegmatis and Methylobacterium pseudosasicola were \nintroduced into the engineered strain, which was designated CHS2. In batch \ncultivation, the CHS2 strain produced more EGT than the CYS-2 strain harboring \nthe same EGT biosynthesis pathway. Interestingly, batch cultivation of the CHS2 \nstrain under high osmotic pressure conditions prolonged the time for EGT \nproduction and increased the intracellular accumulation of EGT. These results \nsuggest that increasing osmotic pressure together with engineering the \nbiosynthesis of cysteine, histidine, and S-adenosylmethionine is an effective \nstrategy for enhancing EGT production in recombinant C. glutamicum harboring \nheterologous EGT biosynthesis pathways. KEY POINTS: • Ergothioneine production \nin C. glutamicum was enhanced by metabolic engineering. • Osmotic pressure \naffects ergothioneine production in engineered C. glutamicum. • Ergothioneine \nmay function as a compatible solute in C. glutamicum.\n\n© 2025.

In this study, coarse (SPM-PM2.5) and fine (PM2.5) particles were \ncollected from suburban and urban, with bacterial communities and 48 chemical \ncompositions. The results showed that PM mass concentrations in Yokohama (urban, \nSPM-PM2.5 =\xa05.6\u202fμg/m3; PM2.5 =\xa011.8\u202fμg/m3) were higher than those in Toyama \n(suburban, SPM-PM2.5 =\xa03.8\u202fμg/m3; PM2.5 =\xa09.4\u202fμg/m3), but values remained below \nJapan\'s environmental standard. Water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) and \nCarbonaceous species (CS) were the dominant chemical compositions, accounting \nfor 65.6\u202f%-72.4\u202f% of the total PM mass. Potential ecological risk (RI) reached a \n"serious" level at both sites (Toyama: 4839.6; Yokohama: 5443.4), with Sb as the \ndominant contributor (Ei = 701.1 and 832.7, respectively), indicating that \nmetal-enriched fine particles may exert ecological pressure even when PM mass \nremains within regulatory limits. Microbial community analysis indicated a \npredominance of plant-associated bacteria such as Methylobacterium (18.9\u202f%) and \nSphingomonas (7.8\u202f%) in Toyama. Yokohama, by contrast, were dominated by \nhuman-associated microorganisms including Corynebacterium (9.5\u202f%) and \nStreptococcus (6.4\u202f%). Co-occurrence network and redundancy analysis (RDA) \nfurther indicated that Yokohama\'s PM2.5 network had 2.8 times higher modularity \nthan Toyama\'s and was mainly driven by As, Pb (representing combustion and \nindustrial source elements, CSE), and elemental carbon (EC), while Toyama was \nprimarily influenced by Fe, K, and Rb (representing sea salt and crustal source \nelements, SCE).

Some CRB are pathogenic and may pose risks to \npublic health. This study investigated the occurrence of CRB in the drinking \nwater system of a megacity in eastern China and explored the mechanisms \nunderlying chlorine resistance in typical CRB. The proportions of CRB among \ntotal culturable bacteria in source water, tap water, and potable water were \n0.05-16.8\u202f%, 39.9-100\u202f%, and 0-45.5\u202f%, respectively. Mycobacterium, \nMethylobacterium, and Bacillus were the most prevalent shared CRB in the three \nwater samples. Mycobacterium mucogenicum TW-3 was identified as a typical CRB \nbased on its high detection frequency (100\u202f%), high concentration (up to 26 \nCFU/mL), and notable resistance to chlorine disinfectant. Its resistance to \nreactive chlorine was attributed to the consumption of disinfectants by the \nextracellular polymeric substances, repair of membrane damage, and upregulation \nof antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, TW-3 activated a thioredoxin-centered \nreducing system to mitigate chlorine dioxide-induced oxidative stress. These \nfindings present important insights into the mechanisms underlying chlorine \nresistance in CRB and provide theoretical support for improving microbial safety \ncontrol in the drinking water system.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

We report a novel acidophilic methylotroph, \nMethylobacterium fujisawaense LAC1 that exhibits a remarkable ability to utilize \nand accumulate both light and heavy REEs. This is the first methylotroph \nreported to utilize and accumulate heavy REEs. Strain LAC1 can grow on acetate, \nglycerol, succinate, 1-butanol, glucose, and dodecane with calcium. \nSpecifically, with certain REEs, LAC1 can also metabolize ethanol, 1-propanol, \n2-propanol, and octane. The ability of LAC1 to use a wide variety of C2 - C12 \ncompounds exceeds that of the ability of reported facultative methylotrophs \n(C2-C6). Genome analysis revealed homologs of REE-dependent alcohol \ndehydrogenases (xoxF1, xoxF2, exaF, PedH) and the PQQ-dependent glucose \ndehydrogenase (GDH). When cultivated with both lanthanum (La) and Ytterbium \n(Yb), methanol-grown LAC1 shows no change in their accumulation, suggesting \ndistinct mechanisms exist for light REE and heavy REE uptake and accumulation. \nThe strain can also extract REEs from cigarette lighter flints for growth, \naccumulate the REEs, and thrive at a low pH of 3. All these findings suggest \nthat strain LAC1 is ideal for sustainable REE biomining.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

To address this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted \ntoward biodegradation and upcycling as sustainable alternatives. Microbial \ndegradation of synthetic plastics has shown advancement. This includes the \nintroduction of novel strains like Aspergillus niger MG654699 for the 3.6% and \n5% degradation of polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene, respectively. \nAlso, Streptomyces sp., Methylobacterium, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas have \nbeen studied to be responsible for mulch film degradation. Advances in \nmetagenomics have further revealed the complexity of microbial consortia for \ndriving these processes, whereas kinetic modeling has provided insights into \ndegradation rates and conditions. Building on this foundation, artificial \nintelligence and machine learning are now expediting enzyme discovery, \noptimizing degradation pathways, and enabling intelligent waste management \nsystems. Similarly, biosensors based on Vibrio fischeri and Escherichia coli \nimprove monitoring by detecting plastic monomers. Beyond degradation, the \nintegration of microbial and chemical processes has enabled the upcycling of \nplastic monomers into value-added products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, \nvanillin, bacterial nanocellulose, fuels, and biochemicals, promoting a circular \nbioeconomy. These advances highlight a paradigm shift from waste accumulation to \nresource recovery, underscoring the potential of biotechnology and engineering \ninnovations to transform plastic management. The review concludes by \nhighlighting the challenges of scalability, environmental variability, and \npolicy support while positioning biodegradation and upcycling as integrated \nstrategies for a sustainable and resilient future.\n\n© 2025.

Through shotgun metagenomics, this study utilizes non-invasive air \nsampling of face masks and aircraft cabin filters to investigate microbial \ndiversity in environments with frequent human interactions, including hospitals \nand airplanes. A comprehensive sampling and analysis workflow was developed, \nincorporating environmental and enrichment protocols to enhance microbial DNA \nrecovery and diversity profiling.\nRESULTS: Despite limitations in biomass, optimized extraction methods allowed \nfor the successful identification of 407 species, with dominant taxa including \nCutibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Sphingomonas hankookensis, and \nMethylobacterium radiotolerans.

This study aimed to explore the taxonomic and functional \nlandscape of airborne bacteria, highlighting the seasonal disparities across \nsummer and autumn seasons, in the public transit air (railway stations) of \nDelhi, a populated megacity characterized by extreme pollution levels and one of \nthe world's busiest railway networks. Metagenomic analyses revealed distinct \nseasonal signatures in microbial community composition and diversity. Alpha \ndiversity was higher during autumn, though not statistically significant, while \nbeta diversity differed significantly between seasons. LEfSe analysis identified \nseason-specific indicator taxa, including Moraxella, Barrientosiimonas, \nMethylobacterium, for autumn and Stutzerimonas, Caulobacter, Pseudomonas for \nsummer, representing a mix of opportunistic pathogens and environmentally \nsignificant taxa. Correlation networks highlighted distinct seasonal clustering \npatterns. Resistome and virulome profiling revealed the presence of different \nresistance gene classes and virulence factor categories in abundance. \nCorrelation networks uncovered significant associations between specific genes \nand bacterial genera, suggesting ecological partitioning in gene carriage. \nTemperature and air quality index explained a part of the variance observed in \nthe taxonomic and functional dynamics. Metagenome-assembled genomes captured \nseasonally distinct taxa, and biosynthetic gene cluster screening identified 317 \ngene clusters, including terpene, RiPP-like, and hserlactone clusters. The \nfindings underscore the ecological complexity and public health relevance of \nairborne bacteria and raise concerns about their potential role in microbial \ntransmission and long-term respiratory health risks. These insights are crucial \nfor public health surveillance, urban air quality management, and guiding future \ninvestigations into the microbial safety of urban environments.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

Genome mining \nhas revealed many predicted siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in \nbacterial genomes, however the structures of their siderophore products remain \nmostly undetermined. This limits our molecular-level understanding of how \nbacteria acquire iron, as well as how they interact with other taxa that may use \nthe same siderophores within bacterial communities. Here, we apply inverse \nstable isotope labeling (InverSIL) to rapidly connect predicted siderophore BGCs \nto their products. With InverSIL, bacteria are grown on 13C-substituted carbon \nsources and then fed predicted biosynthetic precursors at their natural isotopic \nabundance to identify BGC products by mass spectrometry, which removes issues \nwith the availability of isotopically substituted precursors. We use InverSIL to \ndetermine the structures of the siderophore products of predicted BGCs from the \nmethylotrophic genera Methylophilus and Methylobacterium, and the siderophores \nproduced by the opportunistic pathogen Chromobacterium violaceum, which were \npreviously shown to be essential for virulence yet remained structurally \nuncharacterized. We next use this approach to reveal the unexpected production \nof enterobactin by the genera Kushneria and Paracoccus, which was difficult to \npredict from genome sequences due to the distributed nature of the biosynthetic \ngenes within the genomes. Finally, we use InverSIL to discover new siderophores, \ncellulochelin A and B, from the cellulose-degrading plant symbiont Cellulomonas \nsp. strain Leaf334. These findings demonstrate the utility of InverSIL for \nfunctional BGC characterization and expand our molecular understanding of \nbacterial iron acquisition strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.1101/2025.11.05.686764\nPMCID: PMC12637720\nPMID: 41280040\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no \nconflicts of interest.'}]},

West Indian lemongrass \n(Cymbopogon citratus) essential oil (LEO) is effective against a broad range of \nbacteria by inhibiting spore formation, and is considered safe. In this study, \nwe demonstrated its therapeutical potential in the treatment of pitted \nkeratolysis (PK), a superficial skin infection affecting the pressure-bearing \nareas of plantar surfaces. Methods: For in vitro antibacterial efficacy testing, \nLEO was mixed into different ointment bases, including Hydrogelum \nmethylcellulose FoNo VIII., Ungentum oleosum FoNo VIII. (Ung. oleoso), Unguentum \nstearini FoNo VIII. (Ung. stearin), and Vaselinum cholesterinatum FoNo VIII. \n(Vasel. cholest.), at different concentrations of 1, 3, and 5%. These \nformulations were tested on representatives of three bacterial species \nassociated with PK: Kytococcus sedentarius, Dermatophilus congolensis, and \nBacillus thuringiensis. Results: In the in vitro tests, Hydrogelum \nmethylcellulose (HM) gel best supported the antibacterial effects of LEO, \nreducing the number of living bacteria on agar plates by 4-5 orders of magnitude \nin a concentration-dependent manner during the 30 min exposure times. This was \nalso confirmed by the Franz diffusion cell drug release test; after 30 min, \nseveral active compounds could be detected in the HM samples, in contrast to the \nother bases. Shelf-life experiments showed that the HM base supported the \nantibacterial features of 3% LEO for at least 2 years without significant loss \nof efficacy. Conclusions: Our study highlights that ointments containing \nessential oils potentially have a place in the treatment of PK. Therefore, \nantibiotics may potentially be replaced for the treatment of PK, thereby \nreducing environmental antibiotic pressure, which is one of the driving forces \nbehind the spread of antibiotic resistance.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/antibiotics14030241\nPMCID: PMC11939757\nPMID: 40149054\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'}],

The CuNPs retained 70\xa0% of \nits weight whereas the bioflocculant retained only 50\xa0% when heated at a range \nof 100\xa0°C-900\xa0°C. The samples exhibited a UV-Vis spectra between 250 and 300\xa0nm, \nat a range of 200-1400\xa0nm. The flocculating effeciency of CuNPs was optimal at \n0.2\xa0mg/mL (92\xa0%) and cation independent (92\xa0%). pH 7 was the peak maximum as \n98\xa0% of the flocculating activity was obtained. The CuNPs were thermally stable \nthan the bioflocculant as over 80\xa0% of its flocculating activity was retained \neven at high temperatures (121\xa0°C). The CuNPs were not affected by the increase \nin NaCl concentration with the highest NaCl concentration (35\xa0g/L) having the \nhighest flocculating activity of 90\xa0%. CuNPs exhibited antimicrobial activity \nagainst both bacterial strains, with greater susceptibility observed in S. \naureus as compared to the bioflocculant. Thus, CuNPs have a potential to be \napplied in wastewater treatment to replace traditional flocculants.\n\n© 2025 The Authors.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.biotno.2025.02.002\nPMCID: PMC11923817\nPMID: 40115602\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare the following financial \ninterests (e.g., any funding for the research project)/personal relationships \n(e.g., the author is an employee of a profitable company) which may be \nconsidered as potential competing interests: Rajasekhar Pullabhotla gratefully \nacknowledges the financial support from the 10.13039/501100001321National \nResearch Foundation in the form of incentive fund with Grant Number: 103691 and \nResearch Development Grant for Rated Researchers (112145).'},

Here, we investigated the bacterial endophyte \ncommunity of Citrus reticulata grown in the northern Persian Gulf. Bacteria were \nisolated seasonally from healthy trees (root, stem, bark, trunk, leaf, and crown \ntissues) in four regions of Hormozgan province (i.e., Ahmadi, Siyahoo, Sikhoran, \nRoudan), a subtropical hot region in Iran. A total of 742 strains from 17 taxa, \n3 phyla, and 5 orders were found, most of which belonged to Actinobacteria \n(Actinobacteriales) as the dominant group, followed by Firmicutes (Bacillales), \nProteobacteria (Sphingomonadales, Rhizobiales), and Cyanobacteria \n(Synechoccales). The genera included Altererythrobacter, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, \nCellulosimicrobium, Curtobacterium, Kocuria, Kytococcus, Methylopila, \nMycobacterium, Nocardioides, Okiabacterium, Paracraurococcus, and \nPsychrobacillus. The most frequently occurring species included Psychrobacillus \npsychrodurans, Kytococcus schroetri, and Bacillus cereus. In addition, the \noverall colonization frequency and variability of endophytes were higher on the \ntrunks. The leaves showed the lowest species variability in all sampling \nperiods. The frequency of endophyte colonization was also higher in summer. The \nShannon-Wiener (H') and Simpson indices varied with all factors, i.e., region, \nseason, and tissue type, with the maximum in Roudan. Furthermore, 52.9% of the \nstrains were capable of nitrogen fixation, and 70% produced antagonistic \nhydrogen cyanide (HCN). Thus, C. reticulata harbors a variety of bioactive \nbacterial endophytes that could be beneficial for host fitness in such harsh \nenvironments.\n\n© 2024.

The microbiome was \nassociated with occurrence, distal metastasis, and prognosis, and differential \nmethylation changes related to distal metastasis and prognosis were analyzed. \nBi-directional mediation effects of the intratumoral microbiome and host DNA \nmethylation changes on the metastasis and prognosis of STAD were identified by \nmediation analysis.

In this review we \nattempted to draw patterns of its pathogenicity, which seem to vary regarding \nhost immune status and the presence of implantable devices. Evidence suggests \nthis pathogen houses many resistance-forming proteins, which serve to exacerbate \nthe challenge in curing it. Available information on K. schroeteri antibacterial \nsusceptibility is scarce. In this situation, a novel, genome-based antibiotic \nresistance analysis model, previously suggested by Su et al., could aid \nclinicians dealing with unknown infections. In this study we merged data from \nobserved antibiotic resistance patterns with resistance data demonstrated by DNA \nsequences.\nMETHODS: We reviewed all available articles and reports on K. schroeteri, from \npeer-reviewed online databases (ClinicalKey, PMC, Scopus and WebOfScience). \nInformation on patients was then subdivided into patient profiles and tabulated \nindependently. We later performed K. schroeteri genome sequence analysis for \nresistance proteins to understand the trends K. schroeteri exhibits.\nRESULTS: K. schroeteri is resistant to beta-lactams, macrolides and clindamycin. \nIt is susceptible to aminoglycosides, tetracyclines and rifampicin. We combined \ndata from the literature review and sequence analysis and found evidence for the \nexistence of PBP, PBP-2A and efflux pumps as likely determinants of K. \nschroeteri.\nCONCLUSIONS: Reviewing the data permits the speculation that baseline immune \nstatus plays a role in the outcome of a Kytococcal infection. Nonetheless, our \ncase report demonstrates that the outcome of a lower baseline immunity could \nstill be favorable, possibly using rifampicin in first-line treatment of \ninfection caused by K. schroeteri.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/idr13010026\nPMCID: PMC8005950\nPMID: 33799382\n\nConflict of interest statement: We do not have any conflict of interest to \ndeclare.'}]},

West Indian lemongrass \n(Cymbopogon citratus) essential oil (LEO) is effective against a broad range of \nbacteria by inhibiting spore formation, and is considered safe. In this study, \nwe demonstrated its therapeutical potential in the treatment of pitted \nkeratolysis (PK), a superficial skin infection affecting the pressure-bearing \nareas of plantar surfaces. Methods: For in vitro antibacterial efficacy testing, \nLEO was mixed into different ointment bases, including Hydrogelum \nmethylcellulose FoNo VIII., Ungentum oleosum FoNo VIII. (Ung. oleoso), Unguentum \nstearini FoNo VIII. (Ung. stearin), and Vaselinum cholesterinatum FoNo VIII. \n(Vasel. cholest.), at different concentrations of 1, 3, and 5%. These \nformulations were tested on representatives of three bacterial species \nassociated with PK: Kytococcus sedentarius, Dermatophilus congolensis, and \nBacillus thuringiensis. Results: In the in vitro tests, Hydrogelum \nmethylcellulose (HM) gel best supported the antibacterial effects of LEO, \nreducing the number of living bacteria on agar plates by 4-5 orders of magnitude \nin a concentration-dependent manner during the 30 min exposure times. This was \nalso confirmed by the Franz diffusion cell drug release test; after 30 min, \nseveral active compounds could be detected in the HM samples, in contrast to the \nother bases. Shelf-life experiments showed that the HM base supported the \nantibacterial features of 3% LEO for at least 2 years without significant loss \nof efficacy. Conclusions: Our study highlights that ointments containing \nessential oils potentially have a place in the treatment of PK.

RNA sequencing data, clinical information, and DNA methylation data \nwere obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) STAD project. The Kraken 2 \npipeline was employed to explore the microbiome profiles. The microbiome was \nassociated with occurrence, distal metastasis, and prognosis, and differential \nmethylation changes related to distal metastasis and prognosis were analyzed. \nBi-directional mediation effects of the intratumoral microbiome and host DNA \nmethylation changes on the metastasis and prognosis of STAD were identified by \nmediation analysis.

Our analysis revealed \nthat H. pylori and other cancer-related microorganisms were related to the \noccurrence, progression, or prognosis of STAD. The related methylated genes were \nparticularly enriched in related cancer pathways. Kytococcus sedentarius and \nActinomyces oris, which interacted strongly with methylation changes in immune \ngenes, were associated with prognosis.

Acta Dermatovenerol Croat. 2018 Apr;26(1):68-70.\n\nTatami Mats: A Source of Pitted Keratolysis in a Martial Arts Athlete?\n\nBalić A, Bukvić Mokos Z, Marinović B, Ledić Drvar D(1).\n\nAuthor information:\n(1)Daniela Ledić Drvar, MD, PhD, University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Department \nof Dermatology and Venereology, School of Medicine University of Zagreb, Šalata \n4, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia; daniela.ledic.drvar1@zg.t-com.hr.\n\nDear Editor, Pitted keratolysis (PK), also known as keratosis plantaris \nsulcatum, is a non-inflammatory, bacterial, superficial cutaneous infection, \ncharacterized by many discrete superficial crateriform ''pits'' and erosions in \nthe thickly keratinized skin of the weight-bearing regions of the soles of the \nfeet (1). The disease often goes unnoticed by the patient, but when it is \nnoticed it is because of the unbearable malodor and hyperhidrosis of the feet, \nwhich are socially unacceptable and cause great anxiety to many of the patients. \nPK occurs worldwide, with the incidence rates varying based on the environment \nand occupation. The prevalence of this condition does not differ significantly \nbased on age, sex, or race. People who sweat profusely or wash excessively, who \nwear occlusive footwear, or are barefoot especially in hot and humid weather are \nextremely prone to this condition (2). Physicians commonly misdiagnose it as \ntinea pedis or plantar warts. Treatment is quite simple and straightforward, \nwith an excellent expected outcome if treated properly. We report a case of a \n32-year-old male patient with skin changes of approximately one-year duration \ndiagnosed as plantar verrucae, who was referred to our Department for \ncryotherapy. The patient presented with asymptomatic, malodorous punched-out \npits and erosions along with hyperkeratotic skin on the heel and metatarsal \nregion of the plantar aspect of both feet. The arches, toes, and sides of the \nfeet were spared (Figure 1). Except for these skin changes, the patient was \nhealthy and denied any other medical issues. He was an athlete active in martial \narts and had a history of sweating of feet and training barefoot on the tatami \nmat for extended periods of time. The diagnosis of PK was established based on \nthe clinical findings (crateriform pitting and malodor), negative KOH test for \nhyphae, and a history of prolonged sweating in addition to contact of the skin \nwith tatami mats, which are often a source of infection if hygiene measures are \nnot adequately implemented. Swabs could have been helpful to identify causative \norganisms, but they were not crucial for the diagnosis and treatment. The \npatient was prescribed with general measures to prevent excessive sweating \n(cotton socks, open footwear, and proper hygiene), antiseptic potassium \npermanganate foot soaks followed by clindamycin 1% and benzoyl peroxide 5% in a \ngel vehicle twice daily. At the one-month follow-up visit, the skin changes, \nhyperhidrosis, and malodor were entirely resolved (Figure 2). Pitted keratolysis \nis common among athletes (3,4). The manifestations of PK are due to a \nsuperficial cutaneous infection caused by several bacterial Gram-positive \nspecies including Corynebacterium species, Kytococcus sedentarius, Dermatophilus \ncongolensis, Actynomices keratolytica, and Streptomyces that proliferate and \nproduce proteinase and sulfur-compound by-products under appropriate moist \nconditions (5-7). Proteinases digest the keratin and destroy the stratum \ncorneum, producing the characteristic skin findings, while sulfur compounds \n(sulfides, thiols, and thioesters) are responsible for the malodor. Athletes and \nsoldiers who wear occlusive footwear for prolonged periods of time or even \nbarefooted people that sweat extensively and spend time on wet surfaces such as \nlaborers, farmers, and marine workers are more prone to this problem (3,4,8-11). \nMartial arts athletes are at greater risk of skin infections due to the constant \nphysical contact that can lead to transmission of viral, bacterial, and fungal \npathogens directly but also indirectly through contact with the mat and the skin \nflora of an another infected individual. A national survey of the epidemiology \nof skin infections among US high school athletes conducted by Ashack et al. \nsupported the prevalent theory that contact sports are associated with an \nincreased risk of skin infections. In this study, wrestling had the highest skin \ninfection rate of predominantly bacterial origin (53.8%), followed by tinea \n(35.7%) and herpetic lesions (6.7%), which is consistent with other literature \nreporting (12). Being barefoot on the tatami mat in combination with excessive \nsweating and non-compliance with hygiene measures makes martial arts athletes \nmore susceptible to skin infections, including PK. The diagnosis is clinical, by \nmeans of visual examination and recognition of the characteristic odor. \nDermoscopy can be useful, revealing abundant pits with well-marked walls that \nsometimes show the bacterial colonies (13). Cultures, if taken, show \nGram-positive bacilli or coccobacilli. Because of the ease of diagnosis on \nclinical findings, biopsy of pitted keratolysis is rarely performed. Skin \nscraping is often performed to exclude tinea pedis, which is one of the main \ndifferential diagnosis, the others including verrucae, punctate palmoplantar \nkeratoderma, keratolysis exfoliativa, circumscribed palmoplantar hypokeratosis, \nand basal cell nevus syndrome. If unrecognized and left untreated, skin findings \nand smelly feet can last for many years. Sometimes, if unrecognized, PK can be \nmistreated with antifungals, or even with aggressive treatment modalities such \nas cryotherapy. Appropriate treatment includes keeping feet dry with adequate \ntreatment of hyperhidrosis, preventive measures, and topical antibiotic therapy. \nTopical forms of salicylic acid, sulfur, antibacterial soaps, neomycin, \nerythromycin, mupirocin, clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide, clotrimazole, \nimidazoles, and injectable botulinum toxin are all successful in treatment and \nprevention of PK (14,15). Topical antibiotics are the first line of medical \ntreatment, among which fusidic acid, erythromycin 1% (solution or gel), \nmupirocin 2%, or clindamycin are the most recommended (14). As in our case, a \nfixed combination of two approved topical drugs - clindamycin 1%-benzoyl \nperoxide 5% gel, had been already demonstrated by Vlahovich et al. as an \nexcellent treatment option with high adherence and no side-effect (16). The \ncombined effect of this combination showed signiﬁcantly greater effect due to \nthe bactericidal and keratolytic properties of benzoyl peroxide. Additionally, \nthis combination also lowers the risk of resistance of causative microorganisms \nto clindamycin. Skin infections are an important aspect of sports-related \nadverse events. Due to the interdisciplinary nature, dermatologists are not the \nonly ones who should be aware of the disease, but also family medicine doctors, \nsports medicine specialists, and occupational health doctors who should educate \npatients about the etiology of the skin disorder, adequate prevention, and \ntreatment. Athletes must enforce the disinfecting and sanitary cleaning of the \ntatami mats and other practice areas. Keeping up with these measures could \nsignificantly limit the spread of skin infections that can infect athletes \nindirectly, leading to significant morbidity, time loss from competition, and \nsocial anxiety as well.\n\nPMID: 29782305 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"}],

To address this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted \ntoward biodegradation and upcycling as sustainable alternatives. Microbial \ndegradation of synthetic plastics has shown advancement. This includes the \nintroduction of novel strains like Aspergillus niger MG654699 for the 3.6% and \n5% degradation of polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene, respectively. \nAlso, Streptomyces sp., Methylobacterium, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas have \nbeen studied to be responsible for mulch film degradation. Advances in \nmetagenomics have further revealed the complexity of microbial consortia for \ndriving these processes, whereas kinetic modeling has provided insights into \ndegradation rates and conditions. Building on this foundation, artificial \nintelligence and machine learning are now expediting enzyme discovery, \noptimizing degradation pathways, and enabling intelligent waste management \nsystems. Similarly, biosensors based on Vibrio fischeri and Escherichia coli \nimprove monitoring by detecting plastic monomers. Beyond degradation, the \nintegration of microbial and chemical processes has enabled the upcycling of \nplastic monomers into value-added products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, \nvanillin, bacterial nanocellulose, fuels, and biochemicals, promoting a circular \nbioeconomy. These advances highlight a paradigm shift from waste accumulation to \nresource recovery, underscoring the potential of biotechnology and engineering \ninnovations to transform plastic management. The review concludes by \nhighlighting the challenges of scalability, environmental variability, and \npolicy support while positioning biodegradation and upcycling as integrated \nstrategies for a sustainable and resilient future.\n\n© 2025.

Fifty-nine actinomycetes \nstrains were isolated from fifty-six soil samples collected from different \naltitudes and locations in Nepal. These actinomycetes strains were classified \nthrough cultural, morphological, partial 16\xa0S rRNA gene sequence analysis, and \nphylogenetic analysis and were identified as belonging to the genera \nStreptomyces, Kitasatospora, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, Nocardioides, Arthrobacter, \nAmycolatopsis, Promicromonospora, and Rhodococcus. The genus Streptomyces \nappeared to be the most abundant, comprising 44 isolates. Promicromonospora was \nisolated for the first time from high-altitude soils. Of the 59 isolated \nactinomycetes, 29 strains exhibited antimicrobial activity against the tested \nmicroorganisms. The highest activity was observed against fungi and \nGram-negative bacteria, followed by Gram-positive bacteria. The crude extracts \nof Streptomyces olivaceus (13081) and Nocardia thailandica (13105) showed \nbroad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria and fungi. \nUltra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) \nanalysis of these two extracts revealed several antimicrobial compounds such as \nNeoaspergillic acid, Okaramine D, Antimycin A3, Tricycloalternarene A, \nNocardimicin B, 4-O-methylmelleolide, Flocculosin, and Microcolin A.

This study aims to characterize the skin microbiome \ncommunities of young wrestlers and kickboxers in comparison with their \nnon-athlete age-peers.\nMETHODS: A total of 56 combat sport athletes (30 males and 26 females, mean age \n± SD = 18.2 ± 1.5 years) and 25 non-athlete youths (control group: 13 males and \n12 females, mean age ± SD = 19.8 ± 1.2 years) voluntarily consented to \nparticipate in the study conducted by our research team in 2023 and 2024. The \nskin microbiome analysis involved standardized sampling, DNA isolation, \nmolecular sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis, thus enabling detailed \ncharacterization and comparison of the skin microbial community in contact \nsports athletes and the control group.\nRESULTS: Our results revealed notable sexual dimorphism in the skin microbiome \ncomposition of youth. Males showed a higher relative abundance of bacterial \ngenera associated with nosocomial infections and respiratory diseases, while \nfemales had more skin inflammation- and infection-related genera (relative \nabundances in males vs. in females: Corynebacterium-12.0 vs. 7.2; \nLuteimonas-4.4. vs. 1.4; Paracoccus-8.8 vs. 5.0; Psychrobacter-6.3 vs. 4.4; \nCutibacterium-6.4 vs. 11.4; Kocuria-1.6 vs. 3.9; Micrococcus-5.8 vs. 8.5; \nPseudomonas-1.2 vs. 3.4; Streptococcus 3.3 vs. 6.2). We also found skin \nmicrobiome differences between athletes and non-athletes in both sexes: \nwrestlers, who experience frequent skin-to-skin contact and wear less covering \nsportswear, had microbiome profiles distinct from both kickboxers and \nnon-athletes (relative abundances in athletes vs. in non-athletes: \nPsychrobacter-7.3 vs. 0.4; Staphylococcus 9.5 vs. 18.5; predominance of genera \nby sports type: relative abundance of Cutibacterium and Streptococcus was higher \nin kickboxers, and relative abundance of Acinetobacter, Enhydrobacter, \nMicrococcus, and Enhydrobacter was higher in wrestlers). Bacteria linked to skin \ninfections (e.g., Aliterella, Arthrobacter, and Empedobacter) were present in \naround 30% of wrestlers and kickboxers but were absent in the control group.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the heightened risk of skin infections in \ncontact sports and highlight the importance of regular microbiome monitoring and \nhygiene protocols among young athletes.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/sports13090288\nPMCID: PMC12473315\nPMID: 41003594\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no competing \ninterests.'}],

Its gut microbiota may play a crucial role in host \nenvironmental adaptation. To investigate the functional divergence of gut \nmicrobial communities, we performed high-throughput metagenomic sequencing on \n105 wild fecal samples collected from 10 geographic regions around Qinghai Lake. \nThe results revealed significant regional differentiation in key functional \nmodules related to metabolism, antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and \nvirulence-associated pathways. All populations showed enrichment in core \nmetabolic pathways such as carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, with \ncarbohydrate-active enzymes dominated by glycoside hydrolases (GHs) and \nglycosyltransferases (GTs), exhibiting overall functional conservation. Although \npopulations shared many antibiotic- and virulence-related reference genetic \nmarkers, the marker composition associated with distinct resistance mechanisms \nand pathogenic processes exhibited clear population-specific patterns, \nsuggesting differential microbial responses to local environmental pressures. \nCorrelation network analysis further identified core taxa (e.g., Arthrobacter \nand Oscillospiraceae/Bacteroidales lineages) as key genera linking community \nstructure with core metabolic, resistance-related, and virulence-associated \nmarker functions. Overall, the gut microbiota of Przewalski's gazelle exhibits a \ncomplex spatially structured functional differentiation, reflecting \nhost-microbiome co-adaptation under region-specific ecological pressures. These \nfindings provide critical methodological and theoretical support for \nmicroecological health assessment and regionally informed conservation \nmanagement of this endangered species.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/microorganisms13112513\nPMCID: PMC12654606\nPMID: 41304199\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."},

A potential \nbacterial consortium (NH_AQ) was designed, which comprised of Lysinibacillus \nspp., Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Exiguobacterium spp., and Arthrobacter \nspp. Metagenomic analysis of landfill soils indicated predominance of these \nbacterial species, which ensured that the culturable bacteria could be isolated \nfrom landfill sites for PVC degradation. This study was carried out at three \ntemperatures (ambient, 37°C and 50°C). The percentage weight reduction of PVC \nfilms was 31.45\u202f% ± 2 at 37°C. SEM-EDX showed external erosion and changes in \nchemical element composition, due to growth of bacteria as biofilms on PVC films \nat 37\u202f°C. FTIR study confirmed oxidation and dechlorination happening during PVC \nutilization. TGA analysis indicated PVC thermal shifts in presence of consortia \nand ion chromatography too showed a significant reduction in chlorine content. \nOverall findings demonstrated that the designed NH_AQ consortium could degrade \nPVC effectively, offering a promising and sustainable approach to mitigate PVC \npollution through microbial action in future.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

A homologous system exists in Pseudomonas syringae pv. \ntomato DC3000, which is encoded by the single copy genes psyI/psyR. We created a \ndouble knockout mutant of the AHL synthase (psyI) and the AHL receptor (psyR) \ngenes in Pst DC3000 and a corresponding complemented strain to gain insights \ninto their role in plant-pathogen interactions and the metabolic processes \nassociated with this system in vitro. The mutant strain psyI-R- overcomes \nstomatal immunity as the parental strain Pst DC3000. However, the psyI-R- \napoplastic population is significantly smaller than that of Pst DC3000 at three \ndays post inoculation. Furthermore, PsyI/PsyR are required for necrosis but not \nchlorosis in infected tomato leaves, evidenced by the observed pharmacological \nand genetic complementation of the psyI-R- strain. By comparison, the coronatine \ndeficient mutant DB29 is unable to cause neither necrosis nor chlorosis on \nleaves. The reduced virulence of psyI-R- is associated with an intermediate \ninduction level of the tomato PR2b marker gene for salicylic acid signaling and \nreduced expression of bacterial virulence genes in infected leaf tissue. \nTranscriptomic analysis of psyI-R- and DB29 mutants showed misregulation of \ngenes related to bacterial secretion system, chemotaxis, flagellar motility, ABC \ntransporters, and iron transporters and a partial overlap between metabolic \nprocesses regulated by PsyI/PsyR and coronatine. Altogether, these findings \nindicate that the PsyI/PsyR is required for full bacterium virulence at the \nlater stages of infection in tomato leaves.\n\nDOI: 10.1094/PHYTO-05-25-0192-R\nPMID: 41364743'},

To explore \nhost genetic-microbiota interactions and their clinical implications, we \nanalyzed the urinary microbiota (urobiota) and conducted genome-wide association \nstudies (GWAS) for bacterial abundance traits in pediatric UTI and VUR patients \nfrom the RIVUR and CUTIE cohorts. We identified four urobiota community types \nbased on relative abundance, characterized by the genera Enterococcus, \nPrevotella, Pseudomonas, and Escherichia/Shigella, and their associations with \nVUR, age, and toilet training. Children with VUR exhibited decreased microbial \ndiversity and increased abundance of genera that included opportunistic \npathogens, suggesting a disrupted urobiota. We detected genome-wide significant \ngenetic associations with urinary bacterial relative abundances, in or near \ncandidate genes including CXCL12, ABCC1, and ROBO1, which are implicated in \nurinary tract development and response to infection. We showed that Cxcl12 is \ninduced 12 hours after uropathogenic bacterial infection in mouse bladder. The \nassociation with CXCL12 suggests a genetic link between UTI, VUR and \ncardiovascular phenotypes later in life. These findings provide the first \ncharacterization of host genetic influences on the pediatric urobiota in UTI and \nVUR, offering insights into the interplay between disease, host genetics and the \nurobiota composition.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.199689\nPMID: 41364520"},

Data from Eastern Europe and \nthe Caucasus are scarce, limiting region-specific infection control strategies.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter surveillance study across five \ntertiary hospitals in Georgia from May 2020 to December 2023. A total of 484 \nrespiratory specimens were obtained from 397 adult patients with \nmicrobiologically confirmed NP. Pathogen identification was performed using \nculture and MALDI-TOF MS, with antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to \nCLSI guidelines. PCR assays detected major resistance genes. Epidemiological, \nmolecular, and clinical outcomes were evaluated, including temporal trends and \ncomparisons between ICU and non-ICU patients.\nRESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria predominated (71.7%), with Pseudomonas \naeruginosa (41.9%) as the leading pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus \n(21.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (13.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), and \nStreptococcus pneumoniae (9.3%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was identified in \n80% of isolates, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) phenotypes in 18.4%, and \npandrug-resistant (PDR) phenotypes in 1.4%. ESBL prevalence increased from 48.3% \nin 2020 to 79.8% in 2023 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), carbapenemase expression doubled from \n15.0% to 30.2% (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and colistin resistance rose from 2.5% to 8.5% \n(p\u2009<\u20090.05). ICU isolates showed significantly higher MDR and XDR rates than \nthose from non-ICU settings (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Thirty-day mortality correlated with \nresistance phenotype, ranging from 18.2% in susceptible infections to 71.4% in \nPDR cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: This four-year study shows high and increasing antimicrobial \nresistance among NP pathogens in Georgia, especially in ICU settings. The rise \nin ESBL, carbapenemase, and colistin resistance highlights the need to \nstrengthen antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention, and genomic \nsurveillance to control the spread of high-risk strains and improve patient \noutcomes in resource-limited settings.\n\n© 2025.

In polymicrobial environments, it forms dual-species biofilms in \nwhich microbial interactions influence structure, virulence, and antibiotic \nresponse. Sub-inhibitory antibiotic concentrations may modulate these behaviors \ndifferently in single- versus dual-species settings. This study evaluated the \neffect of Tobramycin at ½ minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) on biofilm \nformation and virulence gene expression (toxA, lipA) in P. aeruginosa under \nsingle- and dual-species biofilm conditions. Clinical isolates were tested for \nTobramycin susceptibility, MIC determination, and biofilm production. Biofilm \nbiomass was quantified by microtiter assays, and gene expression was assessed by \nqRT-PCR. Overall, 78% of isolates were resistant to Tobramycin, with most MICs \nat 32\xa0µg/ml (37.3%) and 1024\xa0µg/ml (11.8%). All isolates formed biofilms, \npredominantly at moderate levels (63.08%). Tobramycin at ½ MIC significantly \nreduced biofilm biomass in both single-species (median OD₆₃₀: 0.128\u2009±\u20090.08 to \n0.077\u2009±\u20090.09; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and dual-species biofilms (0.158\u2009±\u20090.037 to \n0.106\u2009±\u20090.041; p\u2009=\u20090.0005). toxA expression decreased markedly in dual-species \nbiofilms compared to single-species (0.003\u2009±\u20090.0002 vs. 0.05\u2009±\u20090.009; \np\u2009=\u20090.0003), while lipA expression showed a nonsignificant decline. In \nconclusion, sub-MIC Tobramycin reduces P. aeruginosa biofilm biomass and \ndownregulates virulence genes, with more pronounced effects in dual-species \nbiofilms. These findings highlight the potential impact of low-level antibiotic \nexposure on biofilm-associated pathogenicity and may inform optimized dosing \nstrategies for chronic polymicrobial infections.\n\n© 2025.

One of the \nprimary pathological features of sepsis is immunosuppression, which is largely \nmediated by endotoxin tolerance. Akkermansia muciniphila (AKK), a gut probiotic, \nis known to modulate host immune responses. There is a pressing need to explore \nits potential role in addressing sepsis-induced immunosuppression.\nMETHODS: To assess the abundance of AKK in immunosuppressed and normal immune \ngroups, 16S rRNA sequencing was conducted. This analysis helped to explore the \ncorrelation between immunosuppression and decreased AKK levels. Flow cytometry \nand ELISA were used to probe the effects of AKK on the phenotype of \nendotoxin-tolerant macrophages and to test its ability to clear Pseudomonas \naeruginosa. An endotoxin-tolerant mouse model was employed to validate the role \nof AKK in alleviating sepsis-induced immunosuppression through its effects on \nmacrophage phenotypes.\nRESULTS: In in vitro experiments, an endotoxin-tolerant macrophage model \nconstructed using RAW 264.7 cells showed that endotoxin-tolerant macrophages \ntended to be of the M2 phenotype, as evidenced by a decrease in M1-type \nmacrophages and an increase in M2-type macrophages. Further in vitro experiments \nshowed that the addition of AKK preparations was able to reduce M2-type \nmacrophages and increase M1-type macrophages, suggesting that AKK bacteria were \nable to induce a shift in endotoxin-tolerant macrophages from the M2 to the M1 \nphenotype. In animal experiments, the endotoxin tolerance model in mice treated \nwith different AKK preparations further confirmed that AKK bacteria alleviated \nthe immunosuppressive state of septic mice by modulating the phenotype of \nendotoxin-tolerant macrophages.\nCONCLUSION: Our research underscores the crucial role of AKK in mitigating \nsepsis-induced immunosuppression by steering the phenotype of endotoxin-tolerant \nmacrophages. This insight positions AKK as a promising candidate for therapeutic \nintervention, potentially leading to advancements in the management of sepsis.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

Given the immense number of possible \ninteractions in microbial communities, their experimental characterization is \nbest guided by testable hypotheses generated through computational predictions. \nHowever, widely adopted software tools-such as those utilizing microbial \nco-occurrence-typically fail to highlight the pathways underlying these \ninteractions. Bridging this gap will require methods that utilize microbial \nactivity data to infer putative target pathways for experimental validation. In \nthis study, we explored a novel approach by applying cross-species co-expression \nto predict interactions from microbial co-culture RNA-sequencing data. \nSpecifically, we investigated the extent to which co-expression between genes \nand pathways of different bacterial species can predict competition, \ncross-feeding, and specialized metabolic interactions. Our analysis of the Mucin \nand Diet-based Minimal Microbiome (MDb-MM) data yielded results consistent with \nprevious findings and demonstrated the method's potential to identify pathways \nthat are subject to resource competition. Our analysis of the Hitchhikers of the \nRhizosphere (THOR) data showed links between related specialized functions, for \ninstance, between antibiotic and multidrug efflux system expression. \nAdditionally, siderophore co-expression and further evidence suggested that \nincreased siderophore production of the Pseudomonas koreensis koreenceine BGC \ndeletion-mutant drives siderophore production in the other community members. In \nsummary, our findings confirm the feasibility of using cross-species \nco-expression to predict pathways potentially involved in microbe-microbe \ninteractions. We anticipate that the approach will also facilitate the discovery \nof novel gene functions through their association with other species' metabolic \npathways, for example, those involved in antibiotic response.IMPORTANCEAn \nimproved mechanistic understanding of microbial interactions can guide targeted \ninterventions or inform the rational design of microbial communities to optimize \nthem for applications such as pathogen control, food fermentation, and various \nbiochemical processes. Existing methodologies for inferring the mechanisms \nbehind microbial interactions often rely on complex model-building and are, \ntherefore, sensitive to the introduction of biases from the incorporated \nexisting knowledge and model-building assumptions. We highlight the microbial \ninteraction prediction potential of cross-species co-expression analysis, which \ncontrasts with these methods by its data-driven nature. We describe the utility \nof cross-species co-expression for various types of interactions and thereby \ninform future studies on use-cases of the approach and the opportunities and \npitfalls that can be expected in its application.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/msystems.01321-25\nPMID: 41363457"},

This study aimed to investigate the factors that determine \nthe structure of microbial communities of three hydrohalophytes of the Southwest \nSpain (Atlantic coastal), in particular Atriplex portulacoides, Salicornia \nperennis and Suaeda vera; and three xerohalophytes of Southeast Spain \n(Mediterranean coast and inland saltmarshes), namely, Atriplex glauca, Anabasis \narticulata and Halocnemum strobilaceum. Samples were collected in three \nlocations and two seasons (autumn and spring) to analyze how plant genetics and \nenvironmental factors influence their microbiota. The analysis was done by \nsequencing the 16S V3-V4 region in samples of different plant compartments: \nendophytes, rhizosphere soils and bare soils. The results showed strong \nattraction of bacteria and archaea to the rhizosphere, although further tight \nselection limits the number of endophytes. A "core" of endophytes common to both \nfunctional halophytes was identified, including the genera Kushneria, Halomonas, \nPseudoalteromonas and Zunongwangia, which were considered generalists. In \naddition, specific genera considered as specialists were found: hydrohalophytes \nshowed affinity for Vibrio, Pseudomonas and Marinomonas, while xerohalophytes \nharbored Marinilactobacillus, Alkalicoccus, Alkalibacterium and Arthrobacter. \nAlthough most endophytes persist across seasons, their relative abundances can \nchange for better adaptation. Clear differences were also encountered among the \nrhizosphere inhabitants in both functional halophytes: whereas halophilic \nammonia oxidizing archaea were prevalent in the rhizosphere of hydrohalophytes, \nversatile adaptive bacteria were predominant in that of xerohalophytes. These \nmicroorganisms play vital roles, including promoting plant growth, participating \nin the carbon and nitrogen metabolisms, and recycling organic matter.

Over a \n14-month period, we studied the frequency of ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance \ndevelopment and mechanisms underlying resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates after \nceftolozane/tazobactam treatment as well as alternative therapeutic options.\nMETHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed with the disc diffusion \nmethod and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Resistance \ngenes and sequence types (ST) were determined by whole genome sequencing (WGS). \nThe ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance mechanism was explored by cloning ampC \ninto the ampC-deficient strain PAO1 and blaAmpC expression experiments.\nRESULTS: Of 50 patients treated, 9 (18%) acquired one or more \nceftolozane/tazobactam-resistant isolates during treatment. WGS revealed various \nmutations in the ampC gene, namely, Thr70Ile, Phe121Leu, Pro154Leu, Gly157Asp, \ndel210-216, Glu221Lys, and the new mutation, Pro217Gln. Cloning experiments \nrevealed that the Pseudomonas-derived cephalosporinase (PDC) polymorphism did \nnot alter mutation effects, mutations did not confer the same resistance level, \nand those conferring the strongest resistance restored susceptibility to \npiperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem despite changes in the oprD \ngene. In clinical isolates, the resistance level conferred by the same mutations \ndiffered, indicating the involvement of other mechanisms, particularly the \noverproduction of AmpC, which is always present due to mutations mainly in AmpD. \nFinally, imipenem/relebactam, colistin, amikacin and cefiderocol could be good \nalternatives for treating ceftolozane/tazobactam-resistant strains.\nCONCLUTION: Ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance development was associated mainly \nwith chromosomal mutations in the ampC gene but also with mutations in its \nregulatory genes. Knowledge about these mutations and gene polymorphisms is \nessential for interpreting resistance phenotypes from genomic data.\n\n© 2025.

Ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) is a \ncritical last-resort agent against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens; \nhowever, resistance is emerging, particularly mediated by blaKPC variants. In \nthis study, we investigated the prevalence and mechanisms of CZA resistance \namong CRPA isolates collected from two tertiary hospitals in Hangzhou between \n2021 and 2022. A total of 273 non-duplicate CRPA isolates were screened, among \nwhich 13.9% (38/273) exhibited CZA resistance (MIC ≥ 16 µg/mL). Whole-genome \nsequencing revealed that resistant strains were highly resistant to carbapenems, \ncephalosporins, and aztreonam but retained partial susceptibility to \naminoglycosides and polymyxins. ST463 was the predominant sequence type (76.3%), \nstrongly associated with blaKPC-2 carriage and virulence genes, such as exoU and \npldA. Notably, three blaKPC variants-KPC-14, KPC-33, and KPC-86-were identified, \nall conferring high-level resistance to CZA (MIC > 32 µg/mL). KPC-86 was \ndiscovered for the first time in P. aeruginosa, embedded in an IS26-flanked \ntransposon, suggesting potential for horizontal transfer. Sequential recovery of \nKPC-86 and KPC-33 from the same patient supports in vivo evolution under \nantibiotic pressure. These findings highlight the evolving threat of CZA \nresistance in CRPA, driven by blaKPC diversification within high-risk clones. \nContinued genomic surveillance and antimicrobial stewardship are urgently needed \nto preserve the efficacy of CZA.IMPORTANCECeftazidime-avibactam (CZA) is one of \nthe few remaining options to treat serious infections caused by drug-resistant \nPseudomonas aeruginosa. However, its effectiveness is now being threatened by \nemerging genetic changes that reduce susceptibility. In this study, we \ninvestigated CZA-resistant strains and uncovered three variants of the \nresistance gene blaKPC, including one-KPC-86-never before seen in P. aeruginosa. \nThis variant was located on a mobile genetic element, raising concerns about its \npotential to spread between bacteria. We also documented the evolution of \nresistance within a single patient, showing how treatment pressure can drive \ngenetic change. By combining clinical, microbiological, and genomic data, our \nfindings highlight an urgent need for ongoing surveillance and careful \nantibiotic use to preserve the usefulness of last-resort drugs like CZA.

Although bacterial coinfections have been associated with T. vaginalis \ninfection outcomes, pertinent data are scarce. This study was aimed at assessing \nvaginal bacterial community changes regarding T. vaginalis outcomes (infection, \nclearance, persistence) during patients' follow-up visits. This was a 1-year \nfollow-up study involving Colombian women who provided two cytological scrapings \nfrom the cervix (one at baseline and another at follow-up), having an average \n12\u2009±\u20091\xa0month follow-up interval. T. vaginalis was detected by conventional PCR \n(Tvk3/7 and BTU9/2 primers). The Illumina Novaseq PE250-platform was used for \nassessing microbiota composition. This study involved 66 women (132 samples); \n68.2% (n\u2009=\u200945) tested negative for T. vaginalis at baseline while 31.8% (n\u2009=\u200921) \nwere initially diagnosed with T. vaginalis infection (99,304 amplicon sequence \nvariants identified/categorised into 62 phyla and 1908 genera). Women who \ncleared T. vaginalis (n\u2009=\u200910) displayed increased microbial richness, while \nthose having persistence (n\u2009=\u200911) had higher microbial diversity. Significant \nchanges were observed regarding genus relative abundance: Lactobacillus \nabundance increased in the clearance group (p\u2009=\u20090.002), Prevotella in the \npersistence group (p\u2009=\u20090.045) and Gardnerella, Megasphaera and Sneathia in the \ngroup having acquired T. vaginalis infection (p\u2009=\u20090.045). Regarding relative \nabundance, logistic regression analysis revealed a positive trend concerning \nSneathia increase (adjusted OR 2.23) and reduced Lactobacillus abundance \n(adjusted OR 0.39) in women with T. vaginalis persistence. DESeq analysis \nrevealed a substantial decrease in the Ornithinimicrobium genus among women \nwithout infection during follow-up, while Ruminococcus increased in women having \nvarious T. vaginalis outcomes. The results suggested that specific bacterial \ngenera present during T. vaginalis infection may influence its clearance, having \npotential implications for improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for \nenhancing women's reproductive health.\n\n© 2025.

Fecal samples were collected from \nthe yaks and subsequently processed for analysis through 16S rDNA and ITS \nsequencing methodologies. The results revealed that different feeding styles \nresult in significant differences in the Alpha diversity of fungi in the gut of \nyaks, while the gut microbiota of captive yaks was relatively conserved. In \naddition, significant differences appeared in the abundance of microorganisms in \ndifferent taxa, phylum Verrucomicrobiota was significantly enriched in group NF \nwhile Firmicutes was higher in group NS. At the genus level, Akkermansia, \nPaenibacillus, Roseburia, Dorea, UCG_012, Anaerovorax and Marvinbryantia were \nenriched in group NF while Desemzia, Olsenella, Kocuria, Ornithinimicrobium and \nParvibacter were higher in group NS (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene \nsequences led to identifying isolates that belong to the phylum Actinobacteria \nwith genetic affiliations to 17 genera: Aeromicrobium, Agrococcus, Arthrobacter, \nBrachybacterium, Corynebacterium, Dietzia, Flaviflexus, Gordonia, Isoptericola, \nJanibacter, Microbacterium, Mycobacterium, Ornithinimicrobium, Pseudonocardia, \nRhodococcus, Streptomyces, and Tessaracoccus. Also, one isolate could not be \nconsistently classified and formed a novel phylogenetic branch related to the \nNocardiopsaceae family. The antimicrobial activity of these isolates was \nevaluated, demonstrating the capability of specific novel isolates to inhibit \nthe growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, this \nstudy shows a rich biodiversity of culturable Actinobacteria, associated to \nmarine sediments from Valparaíso bay, highlighting novel rare Actinobacteria, \nand their potential for the production of biologically active compounds.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmicb.2015.00737\nPMCID: PMC4516979\nPMID: 26284034'},

In this study, soil samples were collected \nfrom different depths (0-60 cm) of farmland that has been subjected to long-term \napplication of livestock wastewater. The vertical distribution of antibiotics, \nbacterial communities, and ARGs were assessed to identify the driving factors \nthat could potentially influence the distribution of ARB and ARGs. The results \ndemonstrated distinguished distributions of antibiotics along the soil depths, \nwith tetracyclines (TCs) mainly found in the top 10 cm of the soil (0.11-0.31 \nμg/kg), while quinolones (QNs), sulfonamides (SAs), and macrolides (MLs) were \ndetected in all 60 cm of soil depth (0.01-0.22 μg/kg). The selection pressure of \nantibiotics to microorganisms led to the proliferation of ARB, especially \ntetracycline-resistant bacteria and erythromycin-resistant bacteria. In terms of \nthe distribution/abundance of ARGs, novA and tetA (58) were relatively higher in \n0-10 cm surface soil, while vanRM and vanRF were mainly detected in the deeper \nsoil. Different ARGs may have the same host bacteria, which lead to the \nemergence of multidrug resistant bacteria, such as Ilumatobacter sp., \nAggregatilinea sp., Rhabdothermincola sp., and Ornithinimicrobium sp. Soil pH, \nelectrical conductivity (EC), and moisture content (MC) could affect the \ndistribution and proliferation of ARB and were found negatively correlated with \nmost of the ARGs except macB. Therefore, it is potentially possible to \neliminate/inhibit the spread of ARGs by adjusting these soil parameters. These \nfindings provide insights into the distribution and dissemination of \nantibiotics, ARB, and ARGs in agricultural practices of livestock wastewater \nirrigation and provide effective mitigation strategies to ensure the safe use of \nlivestock wastewater in agriculture.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/microorganisms13030610\nPMCID: PMC11946449\nPMID: 40142503\n\nConflict of interest statement: Author Hui Wang was employed by the University \nof Jinan, Jinan 250022, China, author Jianhua Du was employed by WSP Australia \nPty Limited, Level 3, Mia Yellagonga Tower 2, 5 Spring Street, Perth, WA 6000, \nAustralia, author Xiaodong Yang was employed by Ningbo University, Ningbo \n315211, China.

Although bacterial coinfections have been associated with T. vaginalis \ninfection outcomes, pertinent data are scarce. This study was aimed at assessing \nvaginal bacterial community changes regarding T. vaginalis outcomes (infection, \nclearance, persistence) during patients' follow-up visits. This was a 1-year \nfollow-up study involving Colombian women who provided two cytological scrapings \nfrom the cervix (one at baseline and another at follow-up), having an average \n12\u2009±\u20091\xa0month follow-up interval. T. vaginalis was detected by conventional PCR \n(Tvk3/7 and BTU9/2 primers). The Illumina Novaseq PE250-platform was used for \nassessing microbiota composition. This study involved 66 women (132 samples); \n68.2% (n\u2009=\u200945) tested negative for T. vaginalis at baseline while 31.8% (n\u2009=\u200921) \nwere initially diagnosed with T. vaginalis infection (99,304 amplicon sequence \nvariants identified/categorised into 62 phyla and 1908 genera). Women who \ncleared T. vaginalis (n\u2009=\u200910) displayed increased microbial richness, while \nthose having persistence (n\u2009=\u200911) had higher microbial diversity. Significant \nchanges were observed regarding genus relative abundance: Lactobacillus \nabundance increased in the clearance group (p\u2009=\u20090.002), Prevotella in the \npersistence group (p\u2009=\u20090.045) and Gardnerella, Megasphaera and Sneathia in the \ngroup having acquired T. vaginalis infection (p\u2009=\u20090.045). Regarding relative \nabundance, logistic regression analysis revealed a positive trend concerning \nSneathia increase (adjusted OR 2.23) and reduced Lactobacillus abundance \n(adjusted OR 0.39) in women with T. vaginalis persistence. DESeq analysis \nrevealed a substantial decrease in the Ornithinimicrobium genus among women \nwithout infection during follow-up, while Ruminococcus increased in women having \nvarious T. vaginalis outcomes. The results suggested that specific bacterial \ngenera present during T. vaginalis infection may influence its clearance, having \npotential implications for improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for \nenhancing women's reproductive health.\n\n© 2025.

The effects of this \nsynergistic approach on soil nutrient content, heavy metal immobilization, and \nmicrobial community structure were assessed.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results indicated that the available phosphate \ncontent in the soil increased by 59.32%. The content of extractable state Pb2 + \nand Cd2 + decreased by 65.06 and 71.26%, respectively. And the soil nutrient \nconditions were significantly improved. Synergistic remediation can \nsignificantly increase the diversity and abundance of soil microbial communities \n(p < 0.05). Janibacter, Lysobacter, Ornithinimicrobium, Bacillus, and \nSalinimicrobium were the main functional flora during soil remediation, with \nsignificant correlations for the promotion of Pb2 + and Cd2 + immobilization and \nthe increase of available phosphate and organic matter.

The \nstructural and functional characteristics of the intestinal microbiota may cause \nalterations within the host's body to a certain extent. The composition of the \ngut microbiota is associated with environmental factors, dietary habits, and \nother pertinent conditions. The investigation into the gut microbiota of yaks \nremained relatively underexplored. An examination of yak gut microbiota holds \npromise in elucidating the complex relationship between microbial communities \nand the adaptive responses of the host to its environment. In this study, yak \nwere selected from two distinct environmental conditions: those raised in sheds \n(NS, n=6) and grazed in Nimu County (NF, n=6). Fecal samples were collected from \nthe yaks and subsequently processed for analysis through 16S rDNA and ITS \nsequencing methodologies. The results revealed that different feeding styles \nresult in significant differences in the Alpha diversity of fungi in the gut of \nyaks, while the gut microbiota of captive yaks was relatively conserved. In \naddition, significant differences appeared in the abundance of microorganisms in \ndifferent taxa, phylum Verrucomicrobiota was significantly enriched in group NF \nwhile Firmicutes was higher in group NS. At the genus level, Akkermansia, \nPaenibacillus, Roseburia, Dorea, UCG_012, Anaerovorax and Marvinbryantia were \nenriched in group NF while Desemzia, Olsenella, Kocuria, Ornithinimicrobium and \nParvibacter were higher in group NS (P<0.05 or P<0.01). There was a significant \ndifference in the function of gut microbiota between the two groups. The \nobserved variations are likely influenced by differences in feeding methods and \nenvironmental conditions both inside and outside the pen.

However, SS also alters the diversity of bacterial \ncommunities. Therefore, during SF, various organic modifiers are used in \ncombination with SS to improve its efficacy. Organic amendments may contain \nantibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) soils \nare vital to ensure food security and ecological balance. However, comprehensive \nstudy on the effects of SS combined with different types of manure on ARGs in \nGVP soils during SF remains unclear. Therefore, this study employed \nhigh-throughput qPCR to explore the effects of different organic amendments \ncombined with SS on the abundance changes of ARGs and mobile genetic elements \n(MGEs) in GVP soils during SF. The abundance and diversity of ARGs and MGEs in \nGVP soils with different manure fertilization and SS decreased during SF. \nHorizontal gene transfer via MGEs (especially integrases 45.80%) induced by \nchanges in environmental factors (NO3--N 14.7% and NH4+-N) was the main factor \nresponsible for the changes in ARGs. Proteobacteria (14.3%) and Firmicutes were \nthe main potential hosts of ARGs. Network analysis suggested that \nOrnithinimicrobium, Idiomarina and Corynebacterium had positive correlations \nwith aminoglycosides, MLSB, and tetracycline resistance genes.

To address this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted \ntoward biodegradation and upcycling as sustainable alternatives. Microbial \ndegradation of synthetic plastics has shown advancement. This includes the \nintroduction of novel strains like Aspergillus niger MG654699 for the 3.6% and \n5% degradation of polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene, respectively. \nAlso, Streptomyces sp., Methylobacterium, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas have \nbeen studied to be responsible for mulch film degradation. Advances in \nmetagenomics have further revealed the complexity of microbial consortia for \ndriving these processes, whereas kinetic modeling has provided insights into \ndegradation rates and conditions. Building on this foundation, artificial \nintelligence and machine learning are now expediting enzyme discovery, \noptimizing degradation pathways, and enabling intelligent waste management \nsystems. Similarly, biosensors based on Vibrio fischeri and Escherichia coli \nimprove monitoring by detecting plastic monomers. Beyond degradation, the \nintegration of microbial and chemical processes has enabled the upcycling of \nplastic monomers into value-added products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, \nvanillin, bacterial nanocellulose, fuels, and biochemicals, promoting a circular \nbioeconomy. These advances highlight a paradigm shift from waste accumulation to \nresource recovery, underscoring the potential of biotechnology and engineering \ninnovations to transform plastic management. The review concludes by \nhighlighting the challenges of scalability, environmental variability, and \npolicy support while positioning biodegradation and upcycling as integrated \nstrategies for a sustainable and resilient future.\n\n© 2025.

Post-treatment relapse is a major clinical \nchallenge, and gut microbiota dysbiosis is hypothesized to be involved.\nMETHODS: We enrolled 88 patients with IBD (46 UC, 42 CD) to investigate gut \nmicrobiota features associated with post-treatment relapse. Fecal samples \ncollected before and after therapy were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. A \nrandom forest (RF) model was developed to evaluate the predictive value of \nmicrobiota signatures for recurrence.\nRESULTS: At baseline (pre-treatment), no differences were observed in gut \nmicrobiota diversity between patients with UC and CD. However, significant \ncompositional differences were observed, with Fusobacterium and Parabacteroides \nenriched in CD patients, and Anaerostipes and Enterococcus enriched in UC \npatients. Post-treatment, there was no significant difference in the α-diversity \nacross IBD patients; however, β-diversity exhibited significant alterations, \nmarked by enrichment of Akkermansia and Lachnoclostridium. Patients maintaining \nremission exhibited significant post-treatment beta-diversity shifts and \nenrichment of Erysipelatoclostridium, Delftia, Tyzzerella, Sphingomonas, \nSubdoligranulum, Proteus, and Enterococcus. Conversely, patients experiencing \nrecurrence showed a significant reduction in Shannon alpha-diversity \npost-treatment and enrichment of UCG-002, Odoribacter, Delftia, Flavonifractor, \nand Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-003. Post-treatment microbiota composition differed \nsignificantly between recurrent and non-recurrent patients, with higher \nalpha-diversity in the non-recurrent group. Non-recurrent patients exhibited \nenrichment of Eubacterium_hallii_group, Clostridioides, UCG-002, Paraprevotella, \nBilophila, Desulfovibrio, Butyricimonas, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Megamonas, \nRomboutsia, Parabacteroides, and Enterococcus, while Delftia was predominantly \nenriched in recurrent patients. The RF model, built using differentially \nabundant genera to distinguish recurrence status, achieved an area under the \ncurve (AUC) of 0.721 in the validation set and 0.861 in the test cohort, \nindicating good predictive performance.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that gut microbiota composition may hold clues \nfor predicting IBD relapse. The RF model is a proof-of-concept that warrants \nexternal validation in prospective, multi-center studies before clinical \napplication.\n\n© 2025 Zhang et al.\n\nDOI: 10.2147/JIR.S558136\nPMCID: PMC12640577\nPMID: 41287773\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors report no conflicts of interest in \nthis work."},

We aimed to \ncharacterize stent-associated alterations in the biliary microbiome using 16S \nrRNA gene sequencing.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed bile samples collected during ERCP from 35 \npatients without clinical or laboratory evidence of acute cholangitis. Patients \nwere categorized into a control group (n = 25; naïve papillae) and an endoscopic \nbiliary stenting (EBS) group (n = 10; previously stented). Microbial composition \nwas assessed using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing after propensity score \nmatching to balance background characteristics.\nRESULTS: Beta diversity differed significantly between groups (PERMANOVA, P < \n0.01), despite no significant differences in alpha diversity. The EBS group \ndemonstrated increased relative abundance of Firmicutes and Fusobacteriota , and \ndepletion of Proteobacteria . Notably, Enterococcus was significantly enriched \nin the EBS group (log fold change 6.74; q < 0.01), whereas Sphingomonas was \nreduced.\nCONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic biliary stenting is associated with distinct bile \nmicrobiome alterations, characterized by enrichment of Enterococcus species in \nclinically stable patients. These findings suggest that stents may predispose to \nopportunistic colonization, providing a potential mechanistic link to future \ncholangitis. Recognizing such preclinical dysbiosis may inform tailored \nantimicrobial strategies and future stent design.\n\nThe Author(s).

To address this challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted \ntoward biodegradation and upcycling as sustainable alternatives. Microbial \ndegradation of synthetic plastics has shown advancement. This includes the \nintroduction of novel strains like Aspergillus niger MG654699 for the 3.6% and \n5% degradation of polyethylene terephthalate and polystyrene, respectively. \nAlso, Streptomyces sp., Methylobacterium, Arthrobacter, and Sphingomonas have \nbeen studied to be responsible for mulch film degradation. Advances in \nmetagenomics have further revealed the complexity of microbial consortia for \ndriving these processes, whereas kinetic modeling has provided insights into \ndegradation rates and conditions. Building on this foundation, artificial \nintelligence and machine learning are now expediting enzyme discovery, \noptimizing degradation pathways, and enabling intelligent waste management \nsystems. Similarly, biosensors based on Vibrio fischeri and Escherichia coli \nimprove monitoring by detecting plastic monomers. Beyond degradation, the \nintegration of microbial and chemical processes has enabled the upcycling of \nplastic monomers into value-added products such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, \nvanillin, bacterial nanocellulose, fuels, and biochemicals, promoting a circular \nbioeconomy. These advances highlight a paradigm shift from waste accumulation to \nresource recovery, underscoring the potential of biotechnology and engineering \ninnovations to transform plastic management. The review concludes by \nhighlighting the challenges of scalability, environmental variability, and \npolicy support while positioning biodegradation and upcycling as integrated \nstrategies for a sustainable and resilient future.\n\n© 2025.

In this study, coarse (SPM-PM2.5) and fine (PM2.5) particles were \ncollected from suburban and urban, with bacterial communities and 48 chemical \ncompositions. The results showed that PM mass concentrations in Yokohama (urban, \nSPM-PM2.5 =\xa05.6\u202fμg/m3; PM2.5 =\xa011.8\u202fμg/m3) were higher than those in Toyama \n(suburban, SPM-PM2.5 =\xa03.8\u202fμg/m3; PM2.5 =\xa09.4\u202fμg/m3), but values remained below \nJapan\'s environmental standard. Water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) and \nCarbonaceous species (CS) were the dominant chemical compositions, accounting \nfor 65.6\u202f%-72.4\u202f% of the total PM mass. Potential ecological risk (RI) reached a \n"serious" level at both sites (Toyama: 4839.6; Yokohama: 5443.4), with Sb as the \ndominant contributor (Ei = 701.1 and 832.7, respectively), indicating that \nmetal-enriched fine particles may exert ecological pressure even when PM mass \nremains within regulatory limits. Microbial community analysis indicated a \npredominance of plant-associated bacteria such as Methylobacterium (18.9\u202f%) and \nSphingomonas (7.8\u202f%) in Toyama. Yokohama, by contrast, were dominated by \nhuman-associated microorganisms including Corynebacterium (9.5\u202f%) and \nStreptococcus (6.4\u202f%). Co-occurrence network and redundancy analysis (RDA) \nfurther indicated that Yokohama\'s PM2.5 network had 2.8 times higher modularity \nthan Toyama\'s and was mainly driven by As, Pb (representing combustion and \nindustrial source elements, CSE), and elemental carbon (EC), while Toyama was \nprimarily influenced by Fe, K, and Rb (representing sea salt and crustal source \nelements, SCE). These findings highlights how land use patterns control the \nsources and composition of airborne microorganisms in atmospheric particles.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Biological control is an environmentally friendly \nand effective strategy, but its success largely depends on the type of bacterial \nstrain used and its ability to regulate rhizosphere soil microorganisms. In this \nstudy, a new bacterium Bacillus velezensis SF-10 was from rhizosphere of healthy \ntomato plants grown in wilt-infested fields, which showed a high control effect \nof 74.14\xa0% against wilt disease in tomato seedlings. The SF-10 can produce \namylase, cellulase, siderophores, and IAA, and has demonstrated stable \ncolonization via a constructed rifampicin resistance marker system. However, it \nis currently unknown how SF-10 inoculation regulates soil microbial communities \nand plant metabolites to achieve disease resistance, especially during the \nseedling stage. Here, we used amplicon sequencing and metabolite profiling \nrevealed that B. velezensis SF-10 significantly altered the structure of the \nrhizosphere microbiota in plants challenged with the wilt pathogen. During this \nprocess, B. velezensis SF-10 recruits various beneficial soil bacteria, \nparticularly Sphingomonas and Flavobacterium, to suppress F. oxysporum. These \nbeneficial bacteria exhibited significant positive correlations with secondary \nmetabolites such as total phenols, flavonoids, and lignin. In summary, B. \nvelezensis SF-10 enhancing plant resistance by regulating the rhizosphere \nmicrobial community and increasing secondary metabolite content, providing \nvaluable insights for the biological control of soil-borne diseases in \nvegetables.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

Here, we conducted a 150-day incubation experiment using \nagricultural soil amended with either polyethylene (PE, conventional) or \npolylactic acid (PLA, biodegradable) MPs to investigate their impact on \nmicrobially mediated P cycling. MPs altered soil P cycling and decreased \navailable phosphorus (AP) by ∼15% after 90 days. Fourier transform infrared \nspectroscopy revealed weakened AP-associated functional groups (P-O-P, P-O, and \nP═O), most pronounced under PLA treatment. These shifts were accompanied by \nreduced abundances of key P-cycling taxa (Bacillus, Paenibacillus, and \nSphingomonas) and downregulation of phosphatase gene abundance (phoA/D/X: -65.4% \nin PE, -59.8% in PLA). Correspondingly, the activities of acid, neutral, and \nalkaline phosphatases were all suppressed, with alkaline phosphatase in \nPE-treated soil reduced by 34.1%. Together, these results demonstrate that MPs \ndisturb biotic transformation pathways, leading to subsequent alterations in the \nchemical speciation of soil P and decreased AP content. Notably, significant \ndisruption was observed for both conventional and biodegradable types. Our \nfindings challenge the prevailing assumption of environmental benignity for \nbiodegradable plastics and underscore the urgent need for mechanistic \nassessments of their byproducts. Such disruption may hinder microbial P \nmobilization and decrease fertilizer use efficiency, ultimately threatening soil \nhealth and agricultural sustainability.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acs.est.5c11806\nPMID: 41346299'}],

Biological control is an environmentally friendly \nand effective strategy, but its success largely depends on the type of bacterial \nstrain used and its ability to regulate rhizosphere soil microorganisms. In this \nstudy, a new bacterium Bacillus velezensis SF-10 was from rhizosphere of healthy \ntomato plants grown in wilt-infested fields, which showed a high control effect \nof 74.14\xa0% against wilt disease in tomato seedlings. The SF-10 can produce \namylase, cellulase, siderophores, and IAA, and has demonstrated stable \ncolonization via a constructed rifampicin resistance marker system. However, it \nis currently unknown how SF-10 inoculation regulates soil microbial communities \nand plant metabolites to achieve disease resistance, especially during the \nseedling stage. Here, we used amplicon sequencing and metabolite profiling \nrevealed that B. velezensis SF-10 significantly altered the structure of the \nrhizosphere microbiota in plants challenged with the wilt pathogen. During this \nprocess, B. velezensis SF-10 recruits various beneficial soil bacteria, \nparticularly Sphingomonas and Flavobacterium, to suppress F. oxysporum. These \nbeneficial bacteria exhibited significant positive correlations with secondary \nmetabolites such as total phenols, flavonoids, and lignin. In summary, B. \nvelezensis SF-10 enhancing plant resistance by regulating the rhizosphere \nmicrobial community and increasing secondary metabolite content, providing \nvaluable insights for the biological control of soil-borne diseases in \nvegetables.\n\nCopyright © 2024.

In \norder to explore the biological mechanisms of nitrogen reduction and companion \nplanting patterns on tomato yield and quality, this study conducted a two-year \npot experiment under different nitrogen application levels and planting \npatterns, multisystem analysis of tomato rhizosphere soil microbial communities \nand root secretions was performed using 16S Illumina MiSeq sequencing and \nLC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. Over two years, the yield of tomatoes grown using \nreduced nitrogen and companion planting increased by 34.26% and 35.54% compared \nto monoculture, and by 1.23% and 3.57% compared to the application of \nconventional nitrogen and companion planting. Nitrogen use efficiency increased \nby 9.81% and 11.36%, respectively. The nitrogen reduction and companion planting \nmodel increased the content of soluble sugars and lycopene, improved soil \ndehydrogenase and protease activity, and changed the composition of rhizosphere \nbacterial communities and root exudates. At all nitrogen application rates, \ncompanion planting increased the abundance of Pseudomonas. In the 30% nitrogen \nreduction and conventional nitrogen application systems, the abundance of \ndifferential metabolites such as methionine and pipecolic acid was significantly \nhigher in companion crops than in tomato monoculture. On the other side, soil \nbacteria and root exudates form a complex network of interactions, in which \nrhizosphere bacteria such as MND1 are positively correlated with Sphingomonas. \nIn summary, the cultivation model of nitrogen reduction and companion planting \nof potato onions changed the composition of the tomato soil bacterial community \nand the metabolic pathways of root exudates, enhanced the activity of nitrogen \nconversion-related enzymes, and promoted the absorption and utilization of \nnitrogen nutrients by tomatoes, which provides a theoretical basis for \nincreasing the yield and quality of tomatoes cultivated with 30% nitrogen \nreduction and companion planting of onions.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Liu, He, Liu, Sun, Su, Lang and Wu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpls.2025.1642078\nPMCID: PMC12673404\nPMID: 41346825\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'}]},

We established a new study algorithm named NOVA - Novel \nOrganism Verification and Analysis to systematically analyze bacterial isolates \nthat cannot be characterized by conventional identification procedures MALDI-TOF \nMS and partial 16\xa0S rRNA gene sequencing using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS).\nRESULTS: We identified a total of 35 bacterial strains that represent \npotentially novel species. Corynebacterium sp. (n\u2009=\u20096) and Schaalia sp. (n\u2009=\u20095) \nwere the predominant genera. Two strains each were identified within the genera \nAnaerococcus, Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, and Peptoniphilus, and one new species \nwas detected within Citrobacter, Dermabacter, Helcococcus, Lancefieldella, \nNeisseria, Ochrobactrum (Brucella), Paenibacillus, Pantoea, Porphyromonas, \nPseudoclavibacter, Pseudomonas, Psychrobacter, Pusillimonas, Rothia, Sneathia, \nand Tessaracoccus. Twenty-seven of 35 strains were isolated from deep tissue \nspecimens or blood cultures. Seven out of 35 isolated strains identified were \nclinically relevant. In addition, 26 bacterial strains that could only be \nidentified at the species level using WGS analysis, were mainly organisms that \nhave been identified/classified very recently.\nCONCLUSION: Our new algorithm proved to be a powerful tool for detection and \nidentification of novel bacterial organisms. Publicly available clinical and \ngenomic data may help to better understand their clinical and ecological role. \nOur identification of 35 novel strains, 7 of which appear to be clinically \nrelevant, shows the wide range of undescribed pathogens yet to define.\n\n© 2023.

The activity of polyphosphate accumulating organisms \n(PAOs) and the composition of biocoenosis are strongly influenced by these \nprocess conditions. Nevertheless, critical knowledge gaps remain regarding the \nrelevance of microbial diversity and the correlations between PAO/GAO community \ncomposition and EBPR process dynamics under different operational conditions. \nThis study demonstrates that Dechloromonas plays a crucial role in the EBPR \nprocess and that the type of carbon source has a more sensitive influence on \nEBPR dynamics than the COD:P ratio, temperature or pH. Using both a microfluidic \nmodel biofilm system (MMBS) and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system, we \nfound that the consumption of glucose resulted in maximal PAO activity, whereas \nEBPR performance was limited when using glycerol, ethanol and amino acids. In \nboth systems, Dechloromonas was the dominant PAO, while in MMBS Zoogloea and in \nSBR Competibacter/Contendobacter were the dominant GAOs. Tessaracoccus (PAO) and \nMicropruina (GAO) were relevant in the fermentation of glucose and glycerol. No \nsignificant effect on EBPR performance was observed between 12 and 20\xa0°C, and \nPAO activity peaked at pH 7.5. Our findings highlight that PAO-GAO competition \nis overestimated. We anticipate that our study provides a deeper understanding \nof the dynamics in the biocoenosis and emphasizes the relevance of biodiversity \nin EBPR systems, which would help guide relevant applications.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

NaClO is a common \nchemical cleaning agent which will inevitably enter the MBR membrane pool and \ncontact with the accumulated MPs in the membrane pool during membrane cleaning \nprocess. Therefore, the focus of this study is the toxicity mechanism of NaClO \nand MPs co-exposure to activated sludge. In this study, the COD, TN, and TP \nremoval efficiencies decreased at first several cycles, and then gradually \nrecovered without NaClO stress. While the nutrient removal efficiency showed a \ncontinuous declination trend with NaClO stress and have no recovery trend. \nMeanwhile, the key enzymes (such as AMO, NXR, NIR and NAR), which could echo the \ntrend of nutrient metabolism. The dominate bacteria related to nitrogen removal \nincluding nitrification (Saccharimonadales) and denitrification (Tessaracoccus, \nMobilicoccus, vadinHA17, Mesorhizobium and Hyphomicrobium) were both inhibited \nwith NaClO and PVC-MPs co-exposed. This study also confirmed that NaClO stress \ncould change the types of MPs leachate and enhance the release of main additives \n(BPA) from MPs. The NaClO and MPs co-exposure could enhance the level of \noxidative stress, which led to the broken of cell membrane. The toxicity \nmechanism of NaClO and MPs co-exposure to activated sludge is as follows: NaClO \ncan increase the oxidative stress level of microplastics, which has nothing to \ndo with the release of trace additives.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the proven and \nefficient ways to counteract odor emissions is the usage of air biofiltration. \nThe purpose of this study was to qualitatively analyze the bacterial community \ncolonizing the biofilm of a biofilter operating at an industrial piggery in \nSwitzerland. The study material consisted of biofilm and leachate water samples. \nThe microbiological analysis consisted of DNA isolation, amplification of the \nbacterial 16S rRNA gene fragment (V3-V4), preparation of a library for \nhigh-throughput sequencing, high-throughput NGS sequencing, filtering of the \nobtained sequencing reads, and evaluation of the species composition in the \nstudied samples. The investigation revealed the presence of the following \nbacterial genera: Pseudochelatococcus, Methyloversatilis, Flexilinea, Deviosia, \nChryseobacterium, Kribbia, Leadbetterella, Corynebacterium, Flavobacterium, \nXantobacter, Tessaracoccus, Staphylococcus, Thiobacillus, Enhydrobacter, \nProteiniclasticum, and Giesbergeria.

The activity of polyphosphate accumulating organisms \n(PAOs) and the composition of biocoenosis are strongly influenced by these \nprocess conditions. Nevertheless, critical knowledge gaps remain regarding the \nrelevance of microbial diversity and the correlations between PAO/GAO community \ncomposition and EBPR process dynamics under different operational conditions. \nThis study demonstrates that Dechloromonas plays a crucial role in the EBPR \nprocess and that the type of carbon source has a more sensitive influence on \nEBPR dynamics than the COD:P ratio, temperature or pH. Using both a microfluidic \nmodel biofilm system (MMBS) and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system, we \nfound that the consumption of glucose resulted in maximal PAO activity, whereas \nEBPR performance was limited when using glycerol, ethanol and amino acids. In \nboth systems, Dechloromonas was the dominant PAO, while in MMBS Zoogloea and in \nSBR Competibacter/Contendobacter were the dominant GAOs. Tessaracoccus (PAO) and \nMicropruina (GAO) were relevant in the fermentation of glucose and glycerol. No \nsignificant effect on EBPR performance was observed between 12 and 20\xa0°C, and \nPAO activity peaked at pH 7.5. Our findings highlight that PAO-GAO competition \nis overestimated. We anticipate that our study provides a deeper understanding \nof the dynamics in the biocoenosis and emphasizes the relevance of biodiversity \nin EBPR systems, which would help guide relevant applications.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

In this study, the metabolism mechanisms of \nbiogenic amines during fermentation of fermented mandarin fish Chouguiyu were \nrevealed based on the metabolic pathways and correlation analysis. Functional \ngenes based on KEGG orthology related to biogenic amine metabolism were selected \nfrom the metagenome and were used to construct the biogenic amine metabolic \npathways in Chouguiyu. A total of 91 and 75 genera were related to the synthesis \nand degradation of biogenic amines, respectively. High concentrations of \ncadaverine and putrescine were observed, while the other biogenic amines were \ndetected in relatively low concentrations. The metabolic mechanisms of various \nbiogenic amines were illuminated by correlation network maps between biogenic \namines and microbial synthesis/degradation enzymes. Lactococcus, Flavobacterium, \nTessaracoccus, and Yoonia could only degrade and not produce biogenic amines. \nAcinetobacter and Enterococcus possessed more abundant enzymes for degradation \nthan synthesis. Amine oxidase (K00276), diamine N-acetyltransferase (K00657), \nand gamma-glutamylputrescine synthase (K09470) were the main biogenic amine \ndegradation enzymes in the microbial community.

Strain T21T could grow at \n20-40\xa0°C (optimum growth at 30\xa0°C), pH 3.0-10.0 (optimum growth at pH 5.0) and \nin the presence of 0-8.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum growth at 2.0%). Based on \nphylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and genome sequences, the \nisolate belongs to the genus Tessaracoccus in the phylum Actinomycetota. It \nexhibited a close relationship with Tessaracoccus palaemonis J1M15T, \nTessaracoccus defluvii LNB-140T, Tessaracoccus flavescens SST-39T, and \nTessaracoccus coleopterorum HDW20T. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities are \n99.8%, 97.9%, 97.9%, and 97.8%, respectively. The major cellular fatty acids \nwere anteiso-C15:0 and C16:0. The main respiratory quinone was MK-9(H4).

Upon landing on a leaf, the pathogen enters through the \nstomata and continues to develop asymptomatically for up to 28 days before \nsymptoms appear. As previous work has yet to adequately determine how the \npathogen behaves during its infective period, we used transcriptomics to gain \ninsights about the in-planta development of the pathogen and explore its use of \neffectors to facilitate this process. Samples from B73 maize inbreds inoculated \nwith an African reference strain of C. zeina (CMW25467) were harvested in a time \ncourse experiment and used for deep RNA sequencing. We used reads mapped to an \nimproved assembly and annotation of the C. zeina CMW25467 genome as a proxy for \nbiomass accumulation. Following the latent period, C. zeina was found to rapidly \naccumulate biomass and showed a nearly 50-fold increase in biomass as symptoms \nappeared. Two distinct transcriptional waves occurred across the infection \nperiod. The first wave showed expression of genes for cellular growth, \nmaintenance and immune avoidance, whereas the second wave was enriched with \ngenes involved in detoxification and carbohydrate catabolism. A total of 140 \nputative effector genes were differentially expressed over the time course, with \nmost upregulated during the mid stage when the switch to necrotrophy occurred. \nTransient expression of three of these C. zeina effectors (CzEcp2, CzNIS1a, \nCzNIS1b) induced plant immunity in Nicotiana spp. resulting in the development \nof cell death. The CzNIS1a effector required a signal peptide for activity in \nNicotiana benthamiana, indicating that it is most likely secreted into the \napoplast for this function. The previously undescribed CzNIS1b family member has \nan N-terminal domain with high sequence and structural identity to CzNIS1a plus \na C-terminal domain made up of four alpha helices. Orthologues of CzNIS1b appear \nto be limited to the Mycosphaerellaceae. This study suggests that a cohort of C. \nzeina effectors expressed during the mid-stage of infection have functions for \nwhich receptors are present in non-host species like tobacco. Altogether, this \nwork suggests C. zeina behaves as a latent necrotroph and provides a foundation \nfor future research into the infection biology of C. zeina.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Nadasen, Buitendag, Visser, Welgemoed, Hein and Berger.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpls.2025.1703682\nPMCID: PMC12676973\nPMID: 41358340\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Notably, the hepatic \nEGCG content was enhanced by 61.8\xa0% after 8-h ingestion of MaS-EGCG complex \ncompared to ingested EGCG alone (p\xa0<\xa00.05). In a high-fat diet-induced MAFLD \nmodel, the MaS-EGCG complex exhibited strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant \nactivities, reducing lipid accumulation via activated AMPK pathway. It further \nenriched beneficial gut microbiota (Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides) \nand short-chain fatty acids, and enhanced intestinal barrier integrity through \nupregulating occludin and ZO-1 expression. Metabolomics identified that the \nMaS-EGCG complex had higher levels of EGCG and its microbial metabolites \n(glucuronidated, methylated, sulphated forms) in the colon compared to ingested \nEGCG alone. Collectively, these findings confirm the MaS-EGCG complex enhances \nEGCG bioavailability via microbiota-polyphenol synergistic interaction and its \namelioration impact on MAFLD via the gut-liver axis, highlighting the potential \nof starch-polyphenol complexes as functional foods to enhance human health.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The pathogen, Fusarium culmorum, is a \nfilamentous fungus capable of infecting crops, such as wheat, barley (Hordeum \nvulgare), and corn (Zea mays). The mycotoxins produced by this pathogen not only \nmarkedly reduce the nutritional value of grains but also pose a serious threat \nto public health. It has been shown that the antimicrobial substances in the \nsecondary metabolites of Bacillus subtilis BS-Z15, mycosubtilin (Myco), and the \ncrude extract of antimicrobial substances (AP), which contains the same content \nof Myco, can significantly inhibit the germination of conidia and mycelial \ngrowth of F. culmorum. It causes the spores to shrink and hyphae to break. The \nantimicrobial rate of A15 treatment reached roughly 77.77% after 4\xa0days. Both AP \nand Myco reduced the disease index of wheat scab, with the control effect of AP \nreaching approximately 54.48% after 21\xa0days of application. The control effect \nand inhibitory effect on pathogens of AP were superior to those of Myco at the \nsame concentration. A transcriptome analysis indicated that the AP primarily \nregulates the proteasome pathway, DNA replication pathway, and peroxisome \npathway in F. culmorum, while Myco primarily influences the proteasome pathway, \nfructose and mannose metabolism, and DNA replication pathway in this pathogen. \nLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the secondary \nmetabolites of BS-Z15, and it was found that in addition to Myco, it also \ncontains substances with antifungal activity or effects on plant growth, \nincluding 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, cinnamaldehyde, acrylamide, piperidine, \nmyriocin, palmitic acid, L-histidine, and indole lactic acid. The secondary \nmetabolites of BS-Z15 have demonstrated significant efficacy in the biological \ncontrol of wheat scab by downregulating the expression of genes in pathways \nrelated to the conversion of compounds, energy metabolism, and cell growth of F. \nculmorum. The AP exhibits superior control and antimicrobial effects compared to \nMyco, which may be attributed to the synergistic interactions between Myco and \nother antimicrobial components found in the secondary metabolites of BS-Z15. \nThis study provides a theoretical foundation for the further exploration of \nother antifungal components within the secondary metabolites of BS-Z15 and lays \nthe groundwork to develop BS-Z15 as a biological control agent.\n\n© 2025.

Previous studies have demonstrated that SET domain gene 102 \n(SDG 102), a gene encoding an H3K36 methyltransferase, plays a crucial role in \nregulating maize growth, development, and stress responses. This study used the \nwild-type (WT), SDG102 overexpression line (OE), and silencing line (SL) of the \ncorn inbred line B73 as materials. After artificial inoculation with S. turcica, \nthe phenotypic characteristics, disease index, yield, and other related traits \nof different strains were compared, and RNA-Seq was used to analyze the changes \nin the gene expression profile. The results showed that overexpression of SDG102 \nsignificantly inhibited pathogen spore germination and hyphal growth and \nenhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the ability to scavenge \nreactive oxygen species in plants prior to S. turcica infection, the opposite \ntrend was observed in SDG102 silencing lines. Compared with the wild-type, 1546 \nand 1837 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) responsive to S. turcica were \nidentified in OE and SL, respectively. These differentially expressed genes \nprimarily function in pathways such as plant-pathogen interactions, plant \nhormone signaling, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In the OE lines, genes \nrelated to plant-pathogen interactions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) \nproduction, and key phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes exhibited higher \nexpression levels. Furthermore, SDG102 regulates the synthesis of auxin (JA) and \nabscisic acid (SA) as well as the transcription of their signaling pathway \ngenes, thereby influencing maize resistance to large leaf spot disease. Under \ncorn leaf blight conditions, SDG102 overexpression increased yield by 9.29% \ncompared to WT, while SL reduced yield by 10.10%. In conclusion, SDG102 enhances \nmaize resistance to NCLB by positively regulating the expression of disease \nresistance genes, antioxidant enzyme activity, and hormone-mediated defense \npathways.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/plants14223463\nPMCID: PMC12655767\nPMID: 41304614\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'}],

The \nthree-event stack maize expresses PAT, CP4 EPSPS, CP4 EPSPS L124P, AAD-1 and the \nmaize endogenous protein with altered expression (EPAE) ZMM28 to confer \nherbicide tolerance and to provide the potential for yield enhancement (PYE) \nunder field conditions.

The molecular characterisation, comparative analysis (agronomic, \nphenotypic and compositional characteristics) and the outcome of the \ntoxicological, allergenicity and nutritional assessment indicate that the \ncombination of the single maize events and of the newly expressed proteins and \nthe EPAE in the three-event stack maize does not give rise to food and feed \nsafety or nutritional concerns.

Thus, critical levels of the element in the leaves and \nthe optimal dose for the maize crop need to be identified. The aim of this study \nwas to evaluate the effect of foliar application of Ni doses on gas exchange, \nnutrition, biochemistry, physiology and grain yield of maize plants. Field \nexperiments were carried out in randomized block design with four replicates and \nfive doses of foliar Ni fertilizing: 0; 20; 40; 80 and 160 g ha- 1, divided into \ntwo applications, totaling 20 plots. A single application of Ni increased the \ntotal chlorophyll content by 38% with 70 g ha- 1 Ni in year I and 44% in year II \nwhen 80 g ha- 1 Ni was applied. Photosynthesis also improved, increasing by 46% \nin year I and 45% in year II. Ni content in the leaves varied from 1.02 to 3.35 \nmg kg- 1 in year I and from 0.33 to 6.32 mg kg-¹ in year II, while the content \nin the grains increased from 0.68 to 1.03 mg kg-¹ Ni in year I and from 0.13 to \n1.05 mg kg- 1 in year II. Yield peaked at 46.50 g ha- 1 Ni in year I and 92.50 g \nha- 1 in year II, increasing grain yield by 15.62% and 5%, respectively, \ncompared to the control (no Ni). The appropriate range of Ni in the leaves was \n1.29 to 1.86 mg kg-¹ in year I and 1.40 to 3.60 mg kg-¹ in year II, with toxic \nlevels above 2.43 mg kg-¹ and 5.80 mg kg-¹, respectively, reducing grain yield \nby approximately 32% in year I and 6% in year II. Overall, foliar Ni \nfertilization improved photosynthesis and grain yield when applied within \nmoderate ranges, although the magnitude of the response varied substantially \nbetween years. These results indicate that Ni use in maize should not rely on a \nsingle fixed dose but should instead be calibrated according to environmental \nconditions and crop responses. Grain Ni levels remained within acceptable \nlimits, reinforcing that moderate foliar Ni application can be used safely when \nproperly managed.\n\n© 2025.

Two main strategies exist: (i) instrumental methods (NMR, FTIR, \nRaman, chromatography, mass spectrometry) with chemometrics to create metabolite \nfingerprints, (ii) DNA-based molecular authentication. DNA methods are robust \nagainst environmental or harvest variations. They start with PCR amplification, \nfollowed by capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence for \nhigh-resolution DNA fragment separation. Additional tools, including \nhigh-resolution melting analysis and flow cytometry, further confirm DNA \namplification. There is a need for methodological platforms in the simple rapid \ntest format amenable to field testing for molecular authentication.\nRESULTS: Unlike existing methods that require costly equipment and specialized \npersonnel, we present a novel method combining multiplex conventional PCR with \ndirect multiplex visual identification of five species by a dry-reagent strip \nbiosensor. Olive, sunflower, soybean, sesame, and corn DNA are differentiated \nduring PCR, as amplification occurs only when the corresponding species is \npresent. PCR products are applied directly to the biosensor eliminating the need \nfor post-PCR enzymic reactions, purification, pretreatment, or heat \ndenaturation, thereby reducing assay time and user steps. The biosensor delivers \nresults within 15-20\xa0min, detecting olive DNA adulteration with as low as 5\xa0% \nsesame, soybean, and sunflower, and 10\xa0% corn. Measurement variability is below \n5\xa0%.\nSIGNIFICANCE: The proposed method integrates multiplex conventional PCR and \ndirect multiplex biosensor, addressing the challenge of multiplex adulteration \ndetection in a rapid, field-deployable format. It offers unique advantages of \nsimplicity, portability, and low cost, with detection by the naked eye \neliminating the need for expensive instrumentation. The multiplexing capability \nallows simultaneous identification of several potential adulterants, making the \nmethod broadly applicable for molecular authenticity assessment of various \nproducts.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

This study \ninvestigated the effects of XOS and COS, derived from sugarcane bagasse (SB) and \ncorn husks (CH) by enzymatic hydrolysis, on the modulation of human intestinal \nmicrobiota in vitro. Cellulose and hemicellulose from SB and CH were obtained \nfrom alkaline treatment (5\xa0% KOH, 121\xa0°C, 1\xa0atm, 15\xa0min). XOS and COS were \nobtained by enzymatic hydrolysis (pH\xa05.0, 50\xa0°C, 2\xa0% solids, 200\xa0rpm, 48\xa0h) \nusing Shearzyme and Celluclast enzyme cocktails (Novozymes®), respectively. The \nconcentrated hydrolysates were then fermented in vitro (37\xa0°C, 48\xa0h) with fecal \nmicrobiota from healthy volunteers, and the microbial communities were analyzed \nusing Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing. The optimal XOS yields were 7.47\xa0g/L (SB) \nand 4.41\xa0g/L (CH), while COS production reached 0.27\xa0g/L (SB) and 0.46\xa0g/L (CH). \nFermentation led to rapid microbial growth and pH reduction within 12\xa0h. COS \npromoted the growth of Actinobacteria, while XOS favored Firmicutes and \nBacteroidota. Both oligosaccharides selectively increased beneficial genera such \nas Bifidobacterium (predominantly with COS), Blautia, Slackia, Collinsella, and \nBacteroides, which promote metabolic health and immune function. COS produced \nhigher concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) (22.33\xa0g/L and 24.39\xa0g/L \nfor SB and CH) compared to XOS (7.62\xa0g/L and 15.82\xa0g/L). SCFAs play important \nroles in reducing intestinal pH, supporting immunity, and inhibiting pathogens. \nThese findings highlight the potential of XOS and COS as nutraceutical \ningredients for beneficial modulation of the gut microbiota.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Upon landing on a leaf, the pathogen enters through the \nstomata and continues to develop asymptomatically for up to 28 days before \nsymptoms appear. As previous work has yet to adequately determine how the \npathogen behaves during its infective period, we used transcriptomics to gain \ninsights about the in-planta development of the pathogen and explore its use of \neffectors to facilitate this process. Samples from B73 maize inbreds inoculated \nwith an African reference strain of C. zeina (CMW25467) were harvested in a time \ncourse experiment and used for deep RNA sequencing. We used reads mapped to an \nimproved assembly and annotation of the C. zeina CMW25467 genome as a proxy for \nbiomass accumulation. Following the latent period, C. zeina was found to rapidly \naccumulate biomass and showed a nearly 50-fold increase in biomass as symptoms \nappeared. Two distinct transcriptional waves occurred across the infection \nperiod. The first wave showed expression of genes for cellular growth, \nmaintenance and immune avoidance, whereas the second wave was enriched with \ngenes involved in detoxification and carbohydrate catabolism. A total of 140 \nputative effector genes were differentially expressed over the time course, with \nmost upregulated during the mid stage when the switch to necrotrophy occurred. \nTransient expression of three of these C. zeina effectors (CzEcp2, CzNIS1a, \nCzNIS1b) induced plant immunity in Nicotiana spp. resulting in the development \nof cell death. The CzNIS1a effector required a signal peptide for activity in \nNicotiana benthamiana, indicating that it is most likely secreted into the \napoplast for this function. The previously undescribed CzNIS1b family member has \nan N-terminal domain with high sequence and structural identity to CzNIS1a plus \na C-terminal domain made up of four alpha helices. Orthologues of CzNIS1b appear \nto be limited to the Mycosphaerellaceae. This study suggests that a cohort of C. \nzeina effectors expressed during the mid-stage of infection have functions for \nwhich receptors are present in non-host species like tobacco. Altogether, this \nwork suggests C. zeina behaves as a latent necrotroph and provides a foundation \nfor future research into the infection biology of C. zeina.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Nadasen, Buitendag, Visser, Welgemoed, Hein and Berger.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpls.2025.1703682\nPMCID: PMC12676973\nPMID: 41358340\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

This study \ninvestigated the effects of XOS and COS, derived from sugarcane bagasse (SB) and \ncorn husks (CH) by enzymatic hydrolysis, on the modulation of human intestinal \nmicrobiota in vitro. Cellulose and hemicellulose from SB and CH were obtained \nfrom alkaline treatment (5\xa0% KOH, 121\xa0°C, 1\xa0atm, 15\xa0min). XOS and COS were \nobtained by enzymatic hydrolysis (pH\xa05.0, 50\xa0°C, 2\xa0% solids, 200\xa0rpm, 48\xa0h) \nusing Shearzyme and Celluclast enzyme cocktails (Novozymes®), respectively. The \nconcentrated hydrolysates were then fermented in vitro (37\xa0°C, 48\xa0h) with fecal \nmicrobiota from healthy volunteers, and the microbial communities were analyzed \nusing Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing. The optimal XOS yields were 7.47\xa0g/L (SB) \nand 4.41\xa0g/L (CH), while COS production reached 0.27\xa0g/L (SB) and 0.46\xa0g/L (CH). \nFermentation led to rapid microbial growth and pH reduction within 12\xa0h. COS \npromoted the growth of Actinobacteria, while XOS favored Firmicutes and \nBacteroidota. Both oligosaccharides selectively increased beneficial genera such \nas Bifidobacterium (predominantly with COS), Blautia, Slackia, Collinsella, and \nBacteroides, which promote metabolic health and immune function. COS produced \nhigher concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) (22.33\xa0g/L and 24.39\xa0g/L \nfor SB and CH) compared to XOS (7.62\xa0g/L and 15.82\xa0g/L). SCFAs play important \nroles in reducing intestinal pH, supporting immunity, and inhibiting pathogens. \nThese findings highlight the potential of XOS and COS as nutraceutical \ningredients for beneficial modulation of the gut microbiota.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, Chang7-2 serves as a \nvaluable model inbred line for genetic and genomic studies, facilitating the \ndiscovery of genes underlying hybrid vigor and other agronomic traits.\nRESULTS: Here, a reference genome assembly and a chemical-induced mutant \npopulation (N\u2009=\u20091,716) through ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS) treatments are \ngenerated using Chang7-2. Each EMS line is whole genome sequenced and compared \nto the Chang7-2 genome, identifying 2,586,769 mutations with 4,939 mutations \ncausing premature stop codons or altered splicing sites. The effect estimation \nof mutations using two large language artificial intelligence (AI) models, \nnamely the protein language model ESM1b and the DNA language model \nPlantCaduceus, reveals 15,264 and 18,326 deleterious mutations, respectively. \nMutation effects estimated with AI models accelerate revelation of four causal \nmutations underlying phenotypes of albino leaf, reduced cuticular wax, altered \nseed color, and male sterility. In addition, allelic expression quantification \nof genic mutations in 13 EMS M1 lines and their M2 heterozygous progeny, which \ncontain both wildtype and mutant alleles, shows that mutant alleles are overall \naccumulated at a lower level compared to wildtype. Such allelic disparity is \nobserved for some synonymous mutations, indicating they may not be biologically \ninconsequential.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI-based estimation of mutation effects offers cross-species \nevidence for functional impacts of mutations. Our study demonstrates its \napplication in revealing deleterious EMS mutations and identifying causal \nmutations responsible for mutant phenotypes.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material \navailable at 10.1186/s13059-025-03890-2.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s13059-025-03890-2\nPMCID: PMC12679783\nPMID: 41351030\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declarations.

Under conditions of salt stress, the quality \nof the turfgrass diminishes, leading to a loss of economic value and a reduction \nin its ability to serve recreational and functional purposes. Salt stress \nresponses are critical for the survival and functionality of turfgrass in saline \nenvironments. Paspalum vaginatum (seashore paspalum), a stress-tolerant \nturfgrass widely used in lawns and golf courses, is an ideal model for studying \nplant stress adaptation. The calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) family, \nkey regulators of plant growth, development, and stress signaling, remains \nuncharacterized in this species. Using evolutionarily conserved CDPK protein \nsequences from Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Zea mays as references, \nwe performed a genome-wide identification of CDPKs in P. vaginatum and \nultimately identified 30 candidate PvCDPK genes. We analyzed conserved domains, \ngene structures, chromosomal distribution, and phylogenetic relationships of \nPvCDPKs. Promoter cis-element analysis identified phytohormone-responsive, \nstress-responsive, and growth/development-related motifs. Quantitative reverse \ntranscription PCR (qRT-PCR) of PvCDPKs demonstrated tissue-specific expression \nprofiles and differential regulation under salt stress, drought stress, cold \nstress, and ABA treatment conditions. Overexpression of PvCDPK5 in A. thaliana \nshowed that the transgenic plants exhibited significantly enhanced salt \ntolerance, accompanied by reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, \ndecreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, increased activities of antioxidant \nenzymes, and improved Na+/K+ balance. Collectively, these results suggest that \nPvCDPK5 regulates plant salt tolerance by mediating the alleviation of oxidative \nstress and maintaining ion homeostasis. Furthermore, insights into turfgrass \nsalt adaptation can inform breeding strategies for other salt-sensitive crops, \nthereby enhancing agricultural productivity in salinized soils.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

Upon landing on a leaf, the pathogen enters through the \nstomata and continues to develop asymptomatically for up to 28 days before \nsymptoms appear. As previous work has yet to adequately determine how the \npathogen behaves during its infective period, we used transcriptomics to gain \ninsights about the in-planta development of the pathogen and explore its use of \neffectors to facilitate this process. Samples from B73 maize inbreds inoculated \nwith an African reference strain of C. zeina (CMW25467) were harvested in a time \ncourse experiment and used for deep RNA sequencing. We used reads mapped to an \nimproved assembly and annotation of the C. zeina CMW25467 genome as a proxy for \nbiomass accumulation. Following the latent period, C. zeina was found to rapidly \naccumulate biomass and showed a nearly 50-fold increase in biomass as symptoms \nappeared. Two distinct transcriptional waves occurred across the infection \nperiod. The first wave showed expression of genes for cellular growth, \nmaintenance and immune avoidance, whereas the second wave was enriched with \ngenes involved in detoxification and carbohydrate catabolism. A total of 140 \nputative effector genes were differentially expressed over the time course, with \nmost upregulated during the mid stage when the switch to necrotrophy occurred. \nTransient expression of three of these C. zeina effectors (CzEcp2, CzNIS1a, \nCzNIS1b) induced plant immunity in Nicotiana spp. resulting in the development \nof cell death. The CzNIS1a effector required a signal peptide for activity in \nNicotiana benthamiana, indicating that it is most likely secreted into the \napoplast for this function. The previously undescribed CzNIS1b family member has \nan N-terminal domain with high sequence and structural identity to CzNIS1a plus \na C-terminal domain made up of four alpha helices. Orthologues of CzNIS1b appear \nto be limited to the Mycosphaerellaceae. This study suggests that a cohort of C. \nzeina effectors expressed during the mid-stage of infection have functions for \nwhich receptors are present in non-host species like tobacco. Altogether, this \nwork suggests C. zeina behaves as a latent necrotroph and provides a foundation \nfor future research into the infection biology of C. zeina.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Nadasen, Buitendag, Visser, Welgemoed, Hein and Berger.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpls.2025.1703682\nPMCID: PMC12676973\nPMID: 41358340\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

The pathogen, Fusarium culmorum, is a \nfilamentous fungus capable of infecting crops, such as wheat, barley (Hordeum \nvulgare), and corn (Zea mays). The mycotoxins produced by this pathogen not only \nmarkedly reduce the nutritional value of grains but also pose a serious threat \nto public health. It has been shown that the antimicrobial substances in the \nsecondary metabolites of Bacillus subtilis BS-Z15, mycosubtilin (Myco), and the \ncrude extract of antimicrobial substances (AP), which contains the same content \nof Myco, can significantly inhibit the germination of conidia and mycelial \ngrowth of F. culmorum. It causes the spores to shrink and hyphae to break. The \nantimicrobial rate of A15 treatment reached roughly 77.77% after 4\xa0days. Both AP \nand Myco reduced the disease index of wheat scab, with the control effect of AP \nreaching approximately 54.48% after 21\xa0days of application. The control effect \nand inhibitory effect on pathogens of AP were superior to those of Myco at the \nsame concentration. A transcriptome analysis indicated that the AP primarily \nregulates the proteasome pathway, DNA replication pathway, and peroxisome \npathway in F. culmorum, while Myco primarily influences the proteasome pathway, \nfructose and mannose metabolism, and DNA replication pathway in this pathogen. \nLiquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the secondary \nmetabolites of BS-Z15, and it was found that in addition to Myco, it also \ncontains substances with antifungal activity or effects on plant growth, \nincluding 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, cinnamaldehyde, acrylamide, piperidine, \nmyriocin, palmitic acid, L-histidine, and indole lactic acid. The secondary \nmetabolites of BS-Z15 have demonstrated significant efficacy in the biological \ncontrol of wheat scab by downregulating the expression of genes in pathways \nrelated to the conversion of compounds, energy metabolism, and cell growth of F. \nculmorum. The AP exhibits superior control and antimicrobial effects compared to \nMyco, which may be attributed to the synergistic interactions between Myco and \nother antimicrobial components found in the secondary metabolites of BS-Z15. \nThis study provides a theoretical foundation for the further exploration of \nother antifungal components within the secondary metabolites of BS-Z15 and lays \nthe groundwork to develop BS-Z15 as a biological control agent.\n\n© 2025.

Previous studies have demonstrated that SET domain gene 102 \n(SDG 102), a gene encoding an H3K36 methyltransferase, plays a crucial role in \nregulating maize growth, development, and stress responses. This study used the \nwild-type (WT), SDG102 overexpression line (OE), and silencing line (SL) of the \ncorn inbred line B73 as materials. After artificial inoculation with S. turcica, \nthe phenotypic characteristics, disease index, yield, and other related traits \nof different strains were compared, and RNA-Seq was used to analyze the changes \nin the gene expression profile. The results showed that overexpression of SDG102 \nsignificantly inhibited pathogen spore germination and hyphal growth and \nenhanced the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the ability to scavenge \nreactive oxygen species in plants prior to S. turcica infection, the opposite \ntrend was observed in SDG102 silencing lines. Compared with the wild-type, 1546 \nand 1837 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) responsive to S. turcica were \nidentified in OE and SL, respectively. These differentially expressed genes \nprimarily function in pathways such as plant-pathogen interactions, plant \nhormone signaling, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In the OE lines, genes \nrelated to plant-pathogen interactions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) \nproduction, and key phenylpropanoid biosynthesis genes exhibited higher \nexpression levels. Furthermore, SDG102 regulates the synthesis of auxin (JA) and \nabscisic acid (SA) as well as the transcription of their signaling pathway \ngenes, thereby influencing maize resistance to large leaf spot disease. Under \ncorn leaf blight conditions, SDG102 overexpression increased yield by 9.29% \ncompared to WT, while SL reduced yield by 10.10%. In conclusion, SDG102 enhances \nmaize resistance to NCLB by positively regulating the expression of disease \nresistance genes, antioxidant enzyme activity, and hormone-mediated defense \npathways.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/plants14223463\nPMCID: PMC12655767\nPMID: 41304614\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'},

Faced with the growing challenge of emerging \ndiseases in agricultural plants and the search for more sustainable \nphytosanitary practices, natural substances are promising alternatives. Xylopia \nfrutescens, known as "pindaiba-da-folha-pequena", native to the Brazilian \nCerrado and traditionally used as an antimicrobial treatment, is still \nlittle-explored in the literature and presents potentially effective compounds \nfor the control of plant diseases. This study characterized the chemical \ncomposition and thermal stability of the X. frutescens essential oil (XEO), \nwhile evaluating its physiological and phytotoxic effects and the potential for \ndisease control in maize and cowpea plants. The main constituents found in X. \nfrutescens essential oil were nopinone (13.75%), spatulenol (12.94%), myrtenal \n(12.47%), and β-pinene (11.02%). Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that X. \nfrutescens is highly volatile, with a large mass loss at 94.74 °C. In bioassays, \nthe oil preserved chlorophyll levels at adequate amounts and activated several \nantioxidant mechanisms, but also showed a dose-dependent phytotoxic effect. In \nvitro assays further confirmed its antifungal activity against key \nphytopathogens, supporting its potential use in disease control. A general \nincrease in the activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate \nperoxidase (APx) and-partially-chitinase (CHIT) was observed. Catalase (CAT) \ndecreased in both maize and cowpea plants treated with this essential oil but \nwas higher in untreated infected plants. Such enzymatic changes suggest that the \noil acts as a natural elicitor of resistance, strengthening biochemical and \nphysiological defenses. Finally, disease severities, as measured by AUDPCs, \ndemonstrated significant reductions in the progress of maize "Curvularia leaf \nspot" (Curvularia lunata) and cowpea "Web blight" (Rhizoctonia solani).

The comprehensive datasets from this study indicate that \nthe on-filter in-cell (OFIC) processing-based "in-cell proteomics" strategy can \neliminate cell lysis of plant leaves and pollen grains, and process proteins \ndirectly, enabling the identification of 9,000 to 12,000 proteins from leaves, \nand 7,000 to 9,000 proteins from pollen grains using one-shot LCMS. The OFIC \nstrategy demonstrated broadly equivalent or better performance over conventional \napproaches in the context of simplicity, speed, digestion effectiveness, and \nquantitation accuracy. Applying the strategy to investigate plant leaf infection \nof N. benthamiana leaves revealed interesting signature proteins that respond \ndifferentially to host-adapted Colletotrichum destructivum and nonhost-adapted \nColletotrichum sublineola fungus. The single-vessel approach bypasses cell \ndisruption, substantially simplifying plant sample preparation while reducing \nthe required sample input and enhancing proteomic sensitivity. It offered a \ngeneralizable approach to study plant leaf infection and other significant \nquestions in plant biology and beyond.\n\nDOI: 10.1101/2025.10.30.685699\nPMCID: PMC12636300\nPMID: 41279518'}],

The \nthree-event stack maize expresses PAT, CP4 EPSPS, CP4 EPSPS L124P, AAD-1 and the \nmaize endogenous protein with altered expression (EPAE) ZMM28 to confer \nherbicide tolerance and to provide the potential for yield enhancement (PYE) \nunder field conditions. The GMO Panel previously assessed the three single maize \nevents and one of the sub-combinations and did not identify safety concerns. No \nnew data on the single maize events or the assessed sub-combination were \nidentified that could lead to modification of the original conclusions on their \nsafety. The molecular characterisation, comparative analysis (agronomic, \nphenotypic and compositional characteristics) and the outcome of the \ntoxicological, allergenicity and nutritional assessment indicate that the \ncombination of the single maize events and of the newly expressed proteins and \nthe EPAE in the three-event stack maize does not give rise to food and feed \nsafety or nutritional concerns. The GMO Panel concludes that three-event stack \nmaize, as described in this application, is as safe as the non-GM comparator and \nnon-GM reference varieties tested and no post-market monitoring of food/feed is \nconsidered necessary. In the case of the release of processed maize \nDP202216\u2009×\u2009NK603\u2009×\u2009DAS 40278-9 or accidental spillage of viable GM maize grains, \ninto the environment, this would not raise environmental safety concerns. The \nGMO Panel assessed the likelihood of interactions among the single events in two \nof the maize sub-combinations not previously assessed and concludes that these \nare expected to be as safe as the single events, the previously assessed \nsub-combination and the three-event stack maize.

Thus, critical levels of the element in the leaves and \nthe optimal dose for the maize crop need to be identified. The aim of this study \nwas to evaluate the effect of foliar application of Ni doses on gas exchange, \nnutrition, biochemistry, physiology and grain yield of maize plants. Field \nexperiments were carried out in randomized block design with four replicates and \nfive doses of foliar Ni fertilizing: 0; 20; 40; 80 and 160 g ha- 1, divided into \ntwo applications, totaling 20 plots. A single application of Ni increased the \ntotal chlorophyll content by 38% with 70 g ha- 1 Ni in year I and 44% in year II \nwhen 80 g ha- 1 Ni was applied. Photosynthesis also improved, increasing by 46% \nin year I and 45% in year II. Ni content in the leaves varied from 1.02 to 3.35 \nmg kg- 1 in year I and from 0.33 to 6.32 mg kg-¹ in year II, while the content \nin the grains increased from 0.68 to 1.03 mg kg-¹ Ni in year I and from 0.13 to \n1.05 mg kg- 1 in year II. Yield peaked at 46.50 g ha- 1 Ni in year I and 92.50 g \nha- 1 in year II, increasing grain yield by 15.62% and 5%, respectively, \ncompared to the control (no Ni). The appropriate range of Ni in the leaves was \n1.29 to 1.86 mg kg-¹ in year I and 1.40 to 3.60 mg kg-¹ in year II, with toxic \nlevels above 2.43 mg kg-¹ and 5.80 mg kg-¹, respectively, reducing grain yield \nby approximately 32% in year I and 6% in year II. Overall, foliar Ni \nfertilization improved photosynthesis and grain yield when applied within \nmoderate ranges, although the magnitude of the response varied substantially \nbetween years. These results indicate that Ni use in maize should not rely on a \nsingle fixed dose but should instead be calibrated according to environmental \nconditions and crop responses. Grain Ni levels remained within acceptable \nlimits, reinforcing that moderate foliar Ni application can be used safely when \nproperly managed.\n\n© 2025.

Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were conducted to \nelucidate molecular responses. Salt (NaCl) and microplastics (MPs), both \nindividually and in combination (PNaCl), significantly inhibited root growth and \nwater metabolism. NaCl and PNaCl stresses upregulated phenylalanine \nammonia-lyase and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase in the phenylpropanoid pathway, \npromoting the accumulation of phenolic metabolites such as ferulic acid, while \nMPs stress had the opposite effect. Under NaCl stress, \ncatechol-O-methyltransferase expression increased, enhancing caffeic acid \nconversion and antioxidant capacity. Additionally, NaCl and PNaCl stresses also \npromoted the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of cutin, suberin, \nand wax, whereas MPs stress suppressed these genes. Overall, maize roots respond \nto NaCl and PNaCl stresses by activating phenylpropanoid metabolism, \naccumulating phenolic compounds, and enhancing the biosynthesis of cutin, \nsuberin, and wax, thereby improving stress resistance and providing insights \ninto plant adaptation to complex environmental conditions.\n\n© 2025 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/ppl.70653\nPMID: 41351221 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'},

Mz49 was isolated from the Egyptian rhizosphere, and \ndemonstrated in vitro production of indole-3-acetic acid (64.89\xa0µg/mL), \nantioxidant activity (IC₅₀\u2009=\u200911.71\xa0µg/mL), and anti-inflammatory properties \n(IC₅₀\u2009=\u200963.1\xa0µg/mL). Whole-genome sequencing revealed a 5.34 Mb genome with \n5,158 protein-coding genes linked to nutrient acquisition, abiotic stress \ntolerance, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Genes associated with nitrogen \nfixation (nirBD, ureABCDEFGJ, amtB), phosphate solubilization (pqqIFL, phoA, \npstIPN), and phytohormone synthesis (iaaT, ysnE, ipdC, ppdC, amiE) were \nidentified.

This genetic potential highlights the strain's \ncontribution to enhanced plant growth and nutrient-use efficiency, particularly \nunder phosphorus-limited conditions. Additionally, stress-response genes \n(sodABC, katE, betB, proABCY, dnaJK, cspA) were identified, conferring \nresistance to oxidative, osmotic, thermal, and cold stresses.

However, the types, structural characteristics, and \nbiological functions of TCP transcription factors in woody plants remain poorly \nunderstood. In this study, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis was conducted \nto identify TCP genes in the hybrid poplar (Populus alba × P. glandulosa, 84K). \nA total of 50 PagTCP genes were detected and mapped across 17 chromosomes. \nMultiple sequence alignment revealed that the PagTCP family could be classified \ninto two major groups: Class I and Class II. Tissue-specific expression \nprofiling and nitrate-responsive qRT-PCR analysis suggested that PagTCP30.1 may \nbe involved in nitrogen-induced root development. Overexpression of PagTCP30.1 \nsignificantly increased both root length and biomass. RNA-seq analysis showed \nthat genes related to sugar metabolism, including PFK1, FBPA, GAPDH, PK, and \nPDC, were significantly upregulated in transgenic lines, whereas AGPase, FFase, \nand FBase were downregulated. Nitrogen metabolism-related genes such as AspAT, \nAs, GS1, and NR also exhibited marked upregulation. In hormone metabolism, genes \nincluding TAA, Det2, KS, NCED, and PLA1 were significantly induced. Hormone \nmetabolome analysis revealed significant changes in the levels of \nindole-3-acetic acid (IAA), abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellins (GA), zeatin \n(Zea), dihydrozeatin (DHZ), and jasmonic acid (JA), which may contribute to the \nobserved alterations in root morphology.

Upon landing on a leaf, the pathogen enters through the \nstomata and continues to develop asymptomatically for up to 28 days before \nsymptoms appear. As previous work has yet to adequately determine how the \npathogen behaves during its infective period, we used transcriptomics to gain \ninsights about the in-planta development of the pathogen and explore its use of \neffectors to facilitate this process. Samples from B73 maize inbreds inoculated \nwith an African reference strain of C. zeina (CMW25467) were harvested in a time \ncourse experiment and used for deep RNA sequencing. We used reads mapped to an \nimproved assembly and annotation of the C. zeina CMW25467 genome as a proxy for \nbiomass accumulation. Following the latent period, C. zeina was found to rapidly \naccumulate biomass and showed a nearly 50-fold increase in biomass as symptoms \nappeared. Two distinct transcriptional waves occurred across the infection \nperiod. The first wave showed expression of genes for cellular growth, \nmaintenance and immune avoidance, whereas the second wave was enriched with \ngenes involved in detoxification and carbohydrate catabolism. A total of 140 \nputative effector genes were differentially expressed over the time course, with \nmost upregulated during the mid stage when the switch to necrotrophy occurred. \nTransient expression of three of these C. zeina effectors (CzEcp2, CzNIS1a, \nCzNIS1b) induced plant immunity in Nicotiana spp. resulting in the development \nof cell death. The CzNIS1a effector required a signal peptide for activity in \nNicotiana benthamiana, indicating that it is most likely secreted into the \napoplast for this function. The previously undescribed CzNIS1b family member has \nan N-terminal domain with high sequence and structural identity to CzNIS1a plus \na C-terminal domain made up of four alpha helices. Orthologues of CzNIS1b appear \nto be limited to the Mycosphaerellaceae. This study suggests that a cohort of C. \nzeina effectors expressed during the mid-stage of infection have functions for \nwhich receptors are present in non-host species like tobacco. Altogether, this \nwork suggests C. zeina behaves as a latent necrotroph and provides a foundation \nfor future research into the infection biology of C. zeina.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Nadasen, Buitendag, Visser, Welgemoed, Hein and Berger.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fpls.2025.1703682\nPMCID: PMC12676973\nPMID: 41358340\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.

Additionally, Chang7-2 serves as a \nvaluable model inbred line for genetic and genomic studies, facilitating the \ndiscovery of genes underlying hybrid vigor and other agronomic traits.\nRESULTS: Here, a reference genome assembly and a chemical-induced mutant \npopulation (N\u2009=\u20091,716) through ethyl methyl sulfonate (EMS) treatments are \ngenerated using Chang7-2. Each EMS line is whole genome sequenced and compared \nto the Chang7-2 genome, identifying 2,586,769 mutations with 4,939 mutations \ncausing premature stop codons or altered splicing sites. The effect estimation \nof mutations using two large language artificial intelligence (AI) models, \nnamely the protein language model ESM1b and the DNA language model \nPlantCaduceus, reveals 15,264 and 18,326 deleterious mutations, respectively. \nMutation effects estimated with AI models accelerate revelation of four causal \nmutations underlying phenotypes of albino leaf, reduced cuticular wax, altered \nseed color, and male sterility. In addition, allelic expression quantification \nof genic mutations in 13 EMS M1 lines and their M2 heterozygous progeny, which \ncontain both wildtype and mutant alleles, shows that mutant alleles are overall \naccumulated at a lower level compared to wildtype. Such allelic disparity is \nobserved for some synonymous mutations, indicating they may not be biologically \ninconsequential.\nCONCLUSIONS: AI-based estimation of mutation effects offers cross-species \nevidence for functional impacts of mutations. Our study demonstrates its \napplication in revealing deleterious EMS mutations and identifying causal \nmutations responsible for mutant phenotypes.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material \navailable at 10.1186/s13059-025-03890-2.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s13059-025-03890-2\nPMCID: PMC12679783\nPMID: 41351030\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declarations.

Moreover, priming may affect \ninteractions with insects that are not the source of the priming cue. We primed \ntall goldenrod (Solidago altissima) plants by exposure to the volatile emission \nof a specialist herbivore, the goldenrod gall fly (Eurosta solidaginis) then \nsubjected the plants to 48\u2009h of herbivory from an unrelated generalist, corn \nearworm (Helicoverpa zea). Using RNA sequencing, we identified \ntranscriptome-wide gene expression patterns between exposed and unexposed \nplants. We identified biotic stress-associated genes that were more abundant \nduring herbivory in primed plants, including defence-related transcription \nfactors, thaumatin-like receptors and chitinases. We observed a surprising rise \nand fall in expression of hundreds of defence-related genes in a 48-h phase in \nprimed damaged plants only. Our results support the hypothesis that primed \ndefences are stronger than typical induced defences and suggest that primed \ndefences target herbivores in the short term. We show that the threat cue from a \nspecialist can affect plant defences against an unrelated herbivore.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

Traditional cultivation and 16S rDNA sequencing were \nconducted with these samples. Three senile cataract controls and one intraocular \nirrigating solution were used as sequencing control.\nRESULTS: Eleven of the 24 samples (45.8%) obtained positive bacterial \ncultivation, and each sample positive for only one species. The 11 \nculture-positive species could all be identified in their corresponding \nsequencing results, but only four strains being the top one pathogen in the \nsequencing. A total of 567 species were isolated using 16S rDNA sequencing, with \nthe top five species being Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus epidermidis, \nStaphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., and Enterococcus faecalis. The dominant \nbacterial strains varied among the different endophthalmitis categories but with \nno significant difference in the overall bacterial spectrum. Bacterial atlas \ncontaining Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, \nActinomycetales_unclassified, Thermus, and Janibacter was shared by the four \ncategories. Aqueous humor bacterial profile showed a higher overlap with \ncontaminating bacteria from the environment.\nCONCLUSIONS: 16S rDNA sequencing is more efficient for endophthalmitis pathogen \nscreening than the traditional cultivation method in terms of positive detection \nrate and the number of bacteria identified. But the risk of environmental \ncontamination exists when using 16S rDNA sequencing method for endophthalmitis \ndiagnosis. Different categories of endophthalmitis displayed diversified \nbacterial composition.\n\n© 2022.

The effects of this \nsynergistic approach on soil nutrient content, heavy metal immobilization, and \nmicrobial community structure were assessed.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results indicated that the available phosphate \ncontent in the soil increased by 59.32%. The content of extractable state Pb2 + \nand Cd2 + decreased by 65.06 and 71.26%, respectively. And the soil nutrient \nconditions were significantly improved. Synergistic remediation can \nsignificantly increase the diversity and abundance of soil microbial communities \n(p < 0.05). Janibacter, Lysobacter, Ornithinimicrobium, Bacillus, and \nSalinimicrobium were the main functional flora during soil remediation, with \nsignificant correlations for the promotion of Pb2 + and Cd2 + immobilization and \nthe increase of available phosphate and organic matter.

However, the \neffect of wildfire disease on cigar tobacco leaves has not been clarified in \ndetail. In this study, the differences in microbiota and chemical factors \nbetween wildfire disease-infected leaves and healthy leaves were characterized \nusing high-throughput Illumina sequencing and a continuous-flow analytical \nsystem, respectively. The results demonstrated significant alterations in the \nstructure of the phyllosphere microbial community in response to wildfire \ndisease, and the infection of P. syringae pv. tabaci led to a decrease in \nbacterial richness and diversity. Furthermore, the content of nicotine, protein, \ntotal nitrogen, and Cl- in diseased leaves significantly increased by 47.86%, \n17.46%, 20.08%, and 72.77% in comparison to healthy leaves, while the levels of \ntotal sugar and reducing sugar decreased by 59.59% and 70.0%, respectively. \nNotably, the wildfire disease had little effect on the content of starch and K+. \nRedundancy analysis revealed that Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Cladosporium, and \nWallemia displayed positive correlations with nicotine, protein, total nitrogen, \nCl- and K+ contents, while Pantoea, Erwinia, Sphingomonas, Terrisporobacter, \nAspergillus, Alternaria, Sampaiozyma, and Didymella displayed positive \ncorrelations with total sugar and reducing sugar contents.

For the sandfish Holothuria \nscabra, a tropical sea cucumber species, there is a scarcity of information on \nits intestinal microbiota in relation to host growth, which could provide \ninsights into the processes that affect growth and identify microorganisms with \nprobiotic or biochemical potential that could improve current production \nstrategies. To address this gap, this study used 16\xa0S rRNA amplicon sequencing \nto characterize differences in gut and fecal microbiota among large and small \njuveniles reared in floating ocean nurseries.\nRESULTS: We recovered 5915 amplicon sequence variants and diversity indices \nrevealed significant differences between large and small juveniles (p\u2009<\u20090.05). \nGut microbiota of large juveniles had lower bacterial diversity than its smaller \ncounterparts. The genus cluster Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia (BCP) \nis the most common and abundant taxa found in the gut for both size categories \nbut less abundant in fecal samples. Small juveniles had a higher abundance of \nmembers from the Roseobacter clade (Rhodobacteriaceae) such as Ruegeria, Shimia, \nPsuedoruegeria and Marivita among others while the genus Schlegelella \n(Caldimonas) and Bosea were primarily found in larger juveniles. Predicted \nphysiological functions identified signatures of metabolism, biosynthesis, and \nbiodegradation pathways unique for each size category. Significant differences \nin diversity and composition were also exhibited between the pooled fecal and \ngut sample types.\nCONCLUSIONS: The bacterial composition in the intestinal tract of the sandfish \nH. scabra is an important factor in the observed growth variability in \naquaculture. The results show differences in diversity, composition and \npredicted physiological functions between the size groups, despite being from \nthe same cohort and environment. It was also evident that the fecal microbiota \ndiffers from the gut and does not correspond to size category, warranting \ncaution in using the fecal matter as a proxy to infer microbial composition and \ninteractions in the gastrointestinal tract. Understanding the roles that these \nmicroorganisms play in sandfish growth could support the development of \nstrategies to manage size variation in captive-bred sea cucumbers, or for the \npromotion and selection for faster-growing individuals.\n\n© 2024.

Microbial platforms characterized by halophilic \nand thermophilic properties, specifically Halomonas halophila and Caldimonas \nthermodepolymerans, were utilized to tackle issues related to sterility demands, \nprocess efficiency, and sustainability. Scenarios incorporating rice straw and \ndiscarded softwood, which are low-cost feedstocks that do not interfere with the \nhuman food supply, were modeled as resources for PHA biosynthesis. Additionally, \na comparison was conducted between traditional chloroform extraction methods and \nenvironmentally friendly hypotonic lysis for the recovery of PHA from \nextremophilic microbial cultures prone to this treatment. Economic indicators \nsuch as net present value, internal rate of return, and payback period, were \nanalyzed to evaluate the economic viability of the process. Findings indicate \nthat the incorporation of extremophilic microorganisms alongside waste \nvalorization techniques could make PHA production economically viable, thereby \ndecreasing dependence on fossil-derived plastics while simultaneously addressing \necological issues. This initial study highlights the necessity for subsequent \nscale-up investigations to authenticate the proposed methodology, which shows \npotential for the sustainable production of PHA.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

For the sandfish Holothuria \nscabra, a tropical sea cucumber species, there is a scarcity of information on \nits intestinal microbiota in relation to host growth, which could provide \ninsights into the processes that affect growth and identify microorganisms with \nprobiotic or biochemical potential that could improve current production \nstrategies. To address this gap, this study used 16\xa0S rRNA amplicon sequencing \nto characterize differences in gut and fecal microbiota among large and small \njuveniles reared in floating ocean nurseries.\nRESULTS: We recovered 5915 amplicon sequence variants and diversity indices \nrevealed significant differences between large and small juveniles (p\u2009<\u20090.05). \nGut microbiota of large juveniles had lower bacterial diversity than its smaller \ncounterparts. The genus cluster Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia (BCP) \nis the most common and abundant taxa found in the gut for both size categories \nbut less abundant in fecal samples. Small juveniles had a higher abundance of \nmembers from the Roseobacter clade (Rhodobacteriaceae) such as Ruegeria, Shimia, \nPsuedoruegeria and Marivita among others while the genus Schlegelella \n(Caldimonas) and Bosea were primarily found in larger juveniles. Predicted \nphysiological functions identified signatures of metabolism, biosynthesis, and \nbiodegradation pathways unique for each size category. Significant differences \nin diversity and composition were also exhibited between the pooled fecal and \ngut sample types.\nCONCLUSIONS: The bacterial composition in the intestinal tract of the sandfish \nH. scabra is an important factor in the observed growth variability in \naquaculture. The results show differences in diversity, composition and \npredicted physiological functions between the size groups, despite being from \nthe same cohort and environment. It was also evident that the fecal microbiota \ndiffers from the gut and does not correspond to size category, warranting \ncaution in using the fecal matter as a proxy to infer microbial composition and \ninteractions in the gastrointestinal tract.

PhaZCma can be efficiently expressed and secreted at an OD600 of 0.5 \nand using 0.05\xa0mM IPTG.

Due to PhaZCma's sensitivity to 3HB reported in this study, a \nbatch-wise PHB degradation and recycling process is recommended. The results \nindicate that the timing of PHB addition in the batch-wise degradation process \nshould consider the PHBeff/PhaZCma ratio, with a suggested threshold of 500 to \nensure sufficient PHB adsorption sites for recycling PhaZCma.

Piglets supplemented with higher doses of hkMm exhibited a \nsignificant increase in salivary adenosine deaminase levels (p\u202f=\u202f0.0042), along \nwith a significant decrease in serum haptoglobin concentration (p\u202f=\u202f0.0263). \nHkMm also appeared to induce a mild increase in circulating leukocyte \npopulations at the end of the study, primarily due to elevated neutrophil \ncounts, with smaller increases in lymphocytes and monocytes. Additionally, \ntreated animals showed an increase in the number of regulatory T cells (FOXP3⁺) \nby immunohistochemistry, along with an increased IFNG response by RT-qPCR. Flow \ncytometry analysis in PBMC showed a decrease in the frequency of CD8β+ T cells \n(p\u202f=\u202f0.0021), together with a higher number of γδ+ T cells in the treated \nanimals throughout the study (p\u202f=\u202f0.0327). On the other hand, histomorphometry \nanalysis revealed a significant increase in mucosal height (p\u202f=\u202f0.0195) and \ncrypt depth (p\u202f=\u202f0.0277) in the intestine of piglets receiving higher doses of \nhkMm. These results indicate that hkMm is a safe paraprobiotic with \nimmunomodulatory potential, capable of enhancing intestinal integrity and \nabsorptive capacity in weaned piglets, supporting its potential as a nutritional \nstrategy to enhance gut health and reduce reliance on antimicrobial agents. \nNevertheless, further studies in animals subjected to a challenge would be \nvaluable to assess hkMm\'s efficacy under immunological stress.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Álvarez-Delgado, Ruedas-Torres, Sánchez-Carvajal, Fristiková, \nRodríguez-Ruiz, Larenas-Muñoz, Cerón, Pallarés, Cardona, Rodríguez-Gómez, \nCarrasco and Gómez-Laguna.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fvets.2025.1660156\nPMCID: PMC12570335\nPMID: 41169677\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

The research presented here deals with the remains of 14 cattle \ndiscovered in a mass grave at the Roman villa of Vilauba in Catalonia, Spain. \nAccording to the archaeological record, it can be ruled out that the animals \nwere slaughtered for consumption, banqueting, or sacrificial purposes. By \ninvestigating the metagenomic sequences generated from the bovine remains, we \nidentified in three individuals a group I Clostridium strain, phylogenetically \nrelated to known producers of botulinum neurotoxins - suggesting that the \nVilauba strain may have had toxigenic potential. Moreover, we discovered a \nMycolicibacterium species phylogenetically related to known opportunistic \npathogens. While no definitive conclusions can be drawn about disease, the \nphylogenetic placement of these taxa and the detection of Clostridium \nvirulence-associated genes suggest a possible role beyond postmortem \ncontamination. Collectively, these findings draw attention to atypical bacterial \nspecies, such as C. sporogenes, which are often overlooked in palaeogenomic \nstudies due to their ambiguous status as environmental microbes, commensals, or \npotential pathogens. Their detection in animal remains highlights that they may \nrepresent a blind spot in our current understanding of livestock health. More \nbroadly, this study underscores the current complexity of investigating such \ntaxa and emphasizes the need for novel methods to disentangle the roles of these \nbacterial species.\n\nDOI: 10.1080/21505594.2025.2580731\nPMCID: PMC12587821\nPMID: 41144656 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: No potential conflict of interest was reported \nby the author(s)."},

In this study, we \ndemonstrate that CRISPR interference-mediated knockdown of argH, a nitrogen \nmetabolism-associated gene encoding argininosuccinate lyase, significantly \nimpairs the growth of Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (formerly Mycobacterium \nsmegmatis). This growth defect was alleviated in a concentration-dependent \nmanner by arginine supplementation. In a goldfish infection model, argH \nknockdown led to a marked reduction in bacterial burden within both liver and \nkidney tissues. Notably, bacitracin and 5-fluorouracil exhibited synergistic \neffects when combined with argH knockdown. Metabolomic profiling revealed \nsignificant perturbations in multiple amino acids, as well as in succinyl-CoA \nand lactate levels, suggesting that suppression of argH impairs M. smegmatis \nproliferation by disrupting amino acid homeostasis and interfering with aerobic \nrespiration.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Microorganisms can S-methylate H2S and MeSH, which can \nbe cytotoxic, to yield non-toxic DMS via MddA or MddH enzymes in largely \nterrestrial or marine environments, respectively. However, the potential of many \nimportant and abundant bacteria like Actinomycetota is underestimated due to \nunknown Mdd enzymes. Here, two novel S-adenosine-methionine-dependent H2S and \nMeSH S-methyltransferases, MddM1 and MddM2 are identified, in the DMS-producing \nactinomycete Mycolicibacterium poriferae (M. poriferae) ZYF656, isolated from \nthe Mariana Trench. M. poriferae ZYF656 MddM1 and MddM2 likely detoxify H2S and \nMeSH and alleviate oxidative stress, since mddM1 and mddM2 transcription is \ninduced by H2S, MeSH, and oxidative stress, and their expression in E. coli \nenhances H2S, MeSH, and oxidative stress tolerance. MddM1 and/or MddM2 are in \n>50% of actinomycetota, including the model Streptomyces species, S. venezuelae, \nbut are also seen in some Chloroflexota, Acidobacteriota, and Proteobacteria. \nmddM1 is always more abundant than mddM2 in diverse environments and is \nprevalent in soils and marsh sediments.

In this study, we successfully cloned and \nheterologously expressed a novel (R)-amine transaminase, MagAT, from \nMycolicibacterium agri. Systematic analysis showed optimal activity at pH 7.0, \nwith the highest reaction rate occurring within 30\xa0min at 50 ℃. However, \nconsidering overall thermal stability, 40℃ was selected as the operating \ntemperature for subsequent experiments. Furthermore, the enzyme retained nearly \n100% catalytic activity in the presence of 10% methanol, DMSO, and chloroform. \nKinetic analysis demonstrated that MagAT possessed high substrate affinity, with \nMichaelis constants (Km) of 5.13\u2009±\u20090.45\xa0mM for (R)-1-phenylethan-1-amine and \n3.73\u2009±\u20090.34\xa0mM for pyruvate. Substrate specificity studies indicated that MagAT \nefficiently catalyzed the conversion of C3-C8 aliphatic amines (e.g., \n(R)-2-aminooctane) and monocyclic aromatic amines (e.g., \n(R)-1-phenylethan-1-amine), whereas its catalytic activity significantly \ndeclined for sterically hindered substrates such as naphthylamine. 3D structural \nmodeling with AlphaFold3 and molecular docking showed that steric hindrance from \nkey residues in the O-pocket critically influences substrate specificity. This \nstudy not only provides an efficient biocatalyst for the biosynthesis of chiral \namines but also establishes a theoretical basis for the rational design of \ntransaminases with broader substrate adaptability.\n\n© 2025.

In this study, \nwe report a full-scale composting process that treats 180\xa0t of dewatered sewage \nsludge per day, achieving complete compost maturation within 10 days, even \nduring freezing winter conditions. The system integrates a pre-fermentation \nreactor equipped with internal heating and aeration, enabling rapid thermophilic \nactivation and maintaining aerobic stability despite ambient temperatures \nfalling below -1.8\xa0°C. Microbial community profiling revealed structured \nthermophilic succession even during the winter process, with Ureibacillus, \nPlanifilum, and Mycolicibacterium enriched during peak activity. Short-chain \nfatty acid analysis indicated rapid acetate degradation during the reactor phase \nand a transient accumulation of butyrate following raw sludge remixing in \nwinter, suggesting brief anaerobic microenvironments that were quickly resolved \nunder resumed aerobic conditions. All major short-chain fatty acids were \ndepleted by the maturation stage, reflecting a stable and sustained aerobic \nenvironment throughout the later composting phases. The final compost satisfied \nagronomic and safety criteria, including organic matter stabilisation, neutral \npH, pathogen elimination, and heavy metal concentrations. These findings \ndemonstrate the feasibility of year-round, thermophilic, and aerobically stable \ncomposting of dewatered sewage sludge at industrial scale. Furthermore, by \nminimizing anaerobic conditions during early decomposition, the system presents \na strong potential for methane avoidance. We highlight its applicability as a \nscalable composting strategy for cold-climate regions, contributing to the \ndevelopment of sustainable sludge valorisation infrastructure within circular \nbioresource and climate-aligned waste management frameworks.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Authors.

Elevated \nBOD and COD levels in sample KES4 indicated organic pollution and coincided with \nthe dominance of Microcystis aeruginosa, a cyanobacterium indicative of \neutrophication. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing generated approximately 213 \nmillion reads, with bacteria constituting 98.85% of the community. Dominant \nphyla included Pseudomonadota and Cyanobacteria. Culturable isolates confirmed \nthe presence of genera such as Limnohabitans, Microcystis, and \nMycolicibacterium.

RNA samples from R. toruloides CBS14 cell cultures grown on \neither CG or CGHH were collected at different timepoints of cultivation, and a \ndifferential gene expression analysis was performed between cells grown at a \nsimilar physiological situation.\nRESULTS: We observed enhanced transcription of genes involved in oxidative \nphosphorylation and enzymes localized in mitochondria in CGHH compared to CG. \nGenes involved in protein turnover, including those encoding ribosomal proteins, \ntranslation elongation factors, and genes involved in building the proteasome \nalso showed an enhanced transcription in CGHH compared to CG. At 10\xa0h \ncultivation, another group of activated genes in CGHH was involved in \nβ-oxidation, handling oxidative stress and degradation of xylose and aromatic \ncompounds. Potential bypasses of the standard GUT1 and GUT2-glycerol \nassimilation pathway were also expressed and upregulated in CGHH 10\xa0h. When the \nadditional carbon sources from HH were completely consumed, at CGHH 36\xa0h, their \ntranscription decreased and NAD+-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase \nwas upregulated compared to CG 60\xa0h, generating NADH instead of NADPH with \nglycerol catabolism. TPI1 was upregulated in CGHH compared to cells grown on CG \nin all physiological situations, potentially channeling the DHAP formed through \nglycerol catabolism into glycolysis.

In order to understand the molecular physiology of lipid synthesis in \nR. toruloides and to advance metabolic engineering, a high-resolution genome is \nrequired. We constructed a genome draft of R. toruloides CBS 14, using a hybrid \nassembly approach, consisting of short and long reads generated by Illumina and \nNanopore sequencing, respectively. The genome draft consists of 23 contigs and 3 \nscaffolds, with a N50 length of 1,529,952\xa0bp, thus largely representing \nchromosomal organization.

We found that the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio \ninfluenced exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, reaching 5.84 ± 0.45 g/L under \nglucose-rich conditions.

Nitrogen starvation is the primary strategy used to \ninduce oil accumulation\xa0in oleaginous yeast\xa0as part of a global stress response. \nWhile research has demonstrated that post-translational modifications (PTMs), \nincluding phosphorylation and protein cysteine thiol oxidation (redox PTMs), are \ninvolved in signaling pathways that regulate stress responses in metazoa and \nalgae, their role in oleaginous yeast remain understudied and unexplored.\nRESULTS: Towards linking the yeast oleaginous phenotype to protein function, we \nintegrated lipidomics, redox proteomics, and phosphoproteomics to investigate \nRhodotorula toruloides under nitrogen-rich and starved conditions over time. Our \nlipidomics results unearthed interactions involving sphingolipids and \ncardiolipins with ER stress and mitophagy. Our redox and phosphoproteomics data \nhighlighted the roles of the AMPK, TOR, and calcium signaling pathways in \nregulation of lipogenesis, autophagy, and oxidative stress response. As a first, \nwe also demonstrated that lipogenic enzymes including fatty acid synthase are \nmodified as a consequence of shifts in cellular redox states due to nutrient \navailability.\nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that lipid accumulation is largely a consequence of \ncarbon rerouting and autophagy governed by changes to PTMs, and not increases in \nthe abundance of enzymes involved in central carbon metabolism and fatty acid \nbiosynthesis. Our systems-level approach sets the stage for acquiring \nmultidimensional data sets for protein structural modeling and predicting the \nfunctional relevance of PTMs using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning \n(AI/ML).

Unlike the conventional yeast Saccharomyces \ncerevisiae, R. toruloides can naturally metabolize xylose, the second most \nabundant sugar in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. However, its native xylose \nmetabolism is inefficient, characterized by slow xylose uptake and accumulation \nof D-arabitol. Moreover, despite its phenotype, research on the enzymes involved \nin xylose metabolism has yet to reach a consensus. Therefore, this review \nprovides a comprehensive analysis of the non-canonical xylose metabolism in R. \ntoruloides, focusing on the properties of key enzymes involved in xylose \nmetabolism. Native xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase exhibit broad \nsubstrate promiscuity compared to their counterparts in the xylose-fermenting \nScheffersomyces stipitis. Additionally, the absence of xylulokinase expression \nunder xylose-utilizing conditions redirects metabolism toward D-arabitol \naccumulation. Consequently, D-arabitol dehydrogenases and ribulokinase play \nessential roles in the xylose metabolism of R. toruloides. These findings \nhighlight the fundamental differences between R. toruloides xylose metabolism \nand the oxidoreductase pathways observed in other xylose-fermenting yeast, \nproviding insights for metabolic engineering strategies to improve xylose \nutilization and enhance bioconversion of cellulosic hydrolysates to different \nbioproducts by R. toruloides.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

However, genetic manipulation of \nR. toruloides has been limited by its high GC content and the lack of a \nreplicating plasmid, necessitating gene integration into the genome of the \nyeast. To address these challenges, we developed the RT-EZ (R. toruloides \nEfficient Zipper) toolkit, a versatile tool based on Golden Gate assembly, \ndesigned to streamline R. toruloides engineering with improved efficiency and \nflexibility. The RT-EZ toolkit simplifies vector construction by incorporating \nnew features such as bidirectional promoters and 2A peptides, color-based \nscreening using RFP, and sequences optimized for both Agrobacterium \ntumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) and easy linearization, enabling \nstraightforward selection and transformation. Notably, the RT-EZ kit can be used \nto construct an expression cassette with four different genes in one assembly \nreaction, significantly improving vector construction speed and efficiency. The \nutility of the RT-EZ toolkit was demonstrated through the successful synthesis \nof arachidonic acid in R. toruloides by coexpressing fatty acid elongases and \ndesaturases. This result underscores the potential of the RT-EZ toolkit to \nadvance synthetic biology in R. toruloides, providing a streamlined method for \naddressing genetic engineering challenges in the yeast.\n\nDOI: 10.1021/acssynbio.4c00848\nPMID: 40232996 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'},

Meanwhile, the roles of enzymes, particularly the condensing enzymes, \ninvolved in VLCFA biosynthesis in R. toruloides remained unclear. In this study, \ntwo elongases, RtELO1 and RtELO2, were identified from R. toruloides U13N3 and \ntheir tertiary structure and catalytic mechanism were investigated using \nmolecular dynamic methods. Both enzymes exhibited typical ELO-like \ncharacteristics, with active sites located within cavities formed by seven \ntransmembrane helixes. RtELO2 displayed higher binding affinity to acyl-CoAs \ncompared to RtELO1, and at least seven amino acid residues, including two \ncrucial histidines in the "HXXHH" box, were identified as important for the \ncondensation reaction. To enhance VLCFA production, an internal ribosome entry \nsite (IRES)-mediated bicistronic strategy was developed to integrate multiple \ngenes into the R. toruloides genome. The efficiency of IRES-mediated translation \ninitiation reached 85.4% of cap-dependent upstream translation, based on EGFP \nfluorescent intensity. Using this strategy, four genes encoding enzymes involved \nin the VLCFA biosynthesis cycle (Rtelo2, RtKCR, RtHCD, and RtECR) were \nintroduced into the U13N3 genome in various combinations. The results indicated \nthat the expression of a single elongase had a modest effect on VLCFA \nproduction, but the simultaneous expression of multiple genes resulted in \ncumulative effects. Notably, the transformant harboring four genes exhibited a \nremarkable 436.8% increase in C22 and C24 VLCFA yield compared to the original \nstrain.\n\n© 2024.

While the number of genetic engineering strategies that employ \nR. toruloides is increasing, the lack of genetic tools available for \nmodification of this yeast is still limiting strain development. For instance, \nseveral strong, constitutive R. toruloides promoters have been characterized, \nbut to date, only five inducible promoters have been identified. Although \nnitrogen-limited cultivation conditions are commonly used to induce lipid \naccumulation in this yeast, no promoters regulated by nitrogen starvation have \nbeen described for R. toruloides.\nRESULTS: In this study, we used a combination of genomics and transcriptomics \nmethods to identify novel R. toruloides promoter sequences that are either \ninducible or repressible by nitrogen starvation. RNA sequencing was used to \nassess gene expression in the recently isolated strain R. toruloides BOT-A2 \nduring exponential growth and during nitrogen starvation, when cultivated with \neither glucose or xylose as the carbon source. The genome of BOT-A2 was \nsequenced using a combination of long- and short-read sequencing and annotated \nwith support of the RNAseq data. Differential expression analysis was used to \nidentify genes with a |log2 fold change|≥\u20092 when comparing their expression \nduring nitrogen depletion to that during exponential growth. The promoter \nregions from 16 of these genes were evaluated for their ability to drive the \nexpression of a fluorescent reporter gene. Three promoters that were clearly \nupregulated under nitrogen starvation and three that were downregulated were \nselected and further characterized. One promoter, derived from gene \nRTBOTA2_003877, was found to function like an on-off switch, as it was only \nupregulated under full nitrogen depletion and downregulated in the presence of \nthe nitrogen source.\nCONCLUSIONS: Six new R. toruloides promoters that were either upregulated or \ndownregulated under nitrogen-starvation were identified. These substantially \ncontribute to the available promoters when engineering this organism and are \nforeseen to be particularly useful for future engineering strategies requiring \nspecific regulation of target genes in accordance with nitrogen availability.\n\n© 2023.

This study investigated the expression of antifungal \nresistance-related genes (ERG11, CDR1, CDR2, and MDR1) in clinical resistant \n(CR) and clinical and laboratory resistant (CLR) strains of these yeasts. \nCervicovaginal samples from patients with recurrent infections were collected, \nmicroscopically examined, and cultured. Yeast species were identified \nphenotypically and genotypically, followed by drug sensitivity testing. Total \nRNA was extracted, reverse transcribed to complementary DNA, and real-time \npolymerase chain reaction was used to quantify target gene expression, comparing \nresults to drug-sensitive controls. Non-Candida albicans species constituted 29% \n(45 cases) of the isolates, with N. glabratus (68%) and P. kudriavzevii (17%) \nbeing the dominant species. Other species included Candida parapsilosis, \nMeyerozyma guilliermondii, Candida orthopsilosis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and \nRhodotorula mucilaginosa. Coinfections with P. kudriavzevii/C. albicans and N. \nglabratus/C. albicans were also observed. Ketoconazole, itraconazole, and \n5-flucytosine demonstrated the best antifungal activity against most species. \nHowever, some N. glabratus isolates were resistant to miconazole, clotrimazole, \nand amphotericin B, while all P. kudriavzevii isolates resisted clotrimazole. \nOverexpression of the CDR1 gene was noted in N. glabratus (CR, 21.53\u2009±\u20091.26; \nCLR, 84.96\u2009±\u20090.67), and the ERG11 and CDR1 genes in P. kudriavzevii (ERG11 for \nCR, 28.56\u2009±\u20092.16; CDR1 for CLR, 35.89\u2009±\u20090.35).

Our hypothesis is that this group of patients is predisposed to fungal \ninfections. To date, the incidence of spontaneous fungal peritonitis (SFP) has \nnot been determined in Mexico; this endeavor is of great importance because many \npatients may be suffering from this condition without receiving targeted \ntreatment, which may increase mortality.\nAIM: To report the incidence of SFP in patients presenting with decompensated LC \nwith ascites.\nMETHODS: This was a prospective, single-center, descriptive, observational and \ncross-sectional study where patients presenting with decompensated LC with \nascites were evaluated from November 2023 to May 2024 in Mexico City. Fungal \ncultures of ascites were performed and the samples kept in an incubator for 10 \ndays to 14 days, and molecular tests (the API 20 C AUX test) were used for \nmolecular characterization.\nRESULTS: Of the 48 patients included, 54.2% were women, 77.1% had a comorbidity, \n47.9% had LC secondary to metabolic dysfunction, 43.8% were classified as \nChild-Pugh C with a model for end-stage liver disease 3.0 median score of 22, \nand 10.4% were in secondary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis \n(SBP). Only four patients had positive cultures where Candida parapsilosis and \nCandida albicans were isolated, with two of the four patients being positive for \nRhodotorula minuta; an SBP incidence of 8.3% was thus calculated. Chronic kidney \ndisease [P = 0.012 and relative risk (RR) = 15] and secondary prophylaxis for \nSBP (P = 0.049 with RR = 8.6) were statistically significant and associated with \na high mortality risk (P = 0.001 with RR = 33).\nCONCLUSION: The presence of infection of fungal origin in ascites in patients \npresenting with cirrhosis increases short- and medium-term mortality; therefore, \nit is recommended that fungal culture tests are performed in those patients who \nvisit the emergency room or experience continuous admission with acute \ndecompensation and no bacteria identified in ascites cultures, and even more so \nin patients with chronic kidney disease and a history of antibiotic use as \nprophylaxis for SBP. Further studies are needed for the identification of \nclinical and biochemical data that can help to define SFP so that its presence \nmay be assessed without the need to wait for a positive fungal culture. Thus, \ntreatment may be initiated early in the hope of having a positive impact on the \nprognosis in this group of patients.\n\n©The Author(s) 2025. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

This study characterized 30 d biofilm \nassembly dynamics on polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA), and biodegradable \npoly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)/polylactic acid (BP) in simulated \nwastewater treatment systems. Integrated multi-parametric analyses revealed \ncyclic di-guanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) as a key biomarker of biofilm \nmaturity, peaking at 15-22 d alongside maximal biomass and extracellular \npolymeric substances (EPS). Subsequent detachment was mediated by β-glucosidase \nand lysozyme, inducing autolysis. Stage-specific transitions included: Initial \nattachment (0-10 d); Microbial colonization (10-22 d); Maturation/Detachment \n(post-22 d). EPS-secreting and plastic-degrading taxa (Pseudomonas and \nRhodotorula) facilitated initial attachment, followed by functional taxa \nmediating nitrogen transformation (Ochrobactrum, Aminobacter, and Cupriavidus) \nand potential biofilm-stabilizing fungi (Rozellomycota-gen-incertae-sedis). PA \nenhanced colonization via amide-driven nitrogen enrichment and elevated c-di-GMP \nlevels, leading to robust biofilms with functional consortia (Zavarzinia, \nSphingopyxis, and Rozellomycota-gen-incertae-sedis). Conversely, BP promoted \ninitial bacterial recruitment (Pseudomonas and Enterobacter) but later inhibited \nsustained growth because of cytotoxic leachates and nutrient competition, \ncausing biomass decline and fungal inhibition at 20 d.

Single-cell oils (SCOs) from \noleaginous yeasts, enriched in unsaturated fatty acids, were evaluated as \nlarvicides. Yeasts from soils and decaying fruits were screened for lipid \naccumulation under nitrogen limitation, identified by molecular methods, \noptimized in shake flasks across pH, carbon source, and carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) \nratios, and the top strain was scaled in a 7-L bioreactor. SCOs were extracted \nand characterized by FTIR, GC-MS, and NMR. Larvicidal activity against \nthird-instar A. aegypti was assessed by mortality, pupation delay, and \ninhibition of adult emergence, and IC50/IC90 values were estimated by probit \nanalysis. Four oleaginous yeasts were confirmed: Moesziomyces aphidis KHL-99, \nRhodosporidium toruloides KHL-101, R. toruloides KHL-103, and Rhodotorula \nsinensis KHL-108. SCOs from KHL-99 and KHL-108 were most active (IC50 ≈ 75 ppm), \nand sublethal doses reduced adult emergence by ~35-40%. Optimization showed that \nnitrogen limitation, pH 5.0-5.5, glycerol as carbon source, and higher C/N \nratios increased lipid accumulation. In bioreactor, KHL-99 reached 8.1 ± 0.4 g/L \nbiomass and 4.75 ± 0.2 g/L lipids (41% dry cell weight). SCOs were enriched in \noleic (C18:1) and linoleic (C18:2) acids, supporting a biochemical basis for \nlarvicidal effects. These findings indicate that yeast-derived SCOs function as \nactive larvicides and can be produced at scale, positioning them as practical \nadditions to integrated vector management. Because these SCOs consist of \nnaturally occurring fatty acids rather than synthetic neurotoxins, they are \nexpected to pose minimal risk to non-target organisms and offer an \nenvironmentally safe alternative for field application.\n\n© 2025.

Oleaginous yeasts, known for their high lipid-accumulating \ncapacity, offer a sustainable route for single-cell oil (SCO) production, \nparticularly in arid regions where PDW is prevalent. However, the efficient \nbio-conversion of such lignocellulosic feedstocks requires robust microbial \nstrains and optimized fermentation strategies. In this study, an isolated strain \nof Rhodotorula glutinis KAEC-61 from mangrove sediments was selected from \nseveral isolates for its superior lipid-producing ability. Initial flask-level \nscreening under non-optimized conditions yielded 1.9\u2009±\u20090.10\xa0g/L biomass and \n0.56\u2009±\u20090.06\xa0g/L lipid titer (29% lipid content). Optimization via the \none-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) method increased biomass and lipid production by \n4.4-fold and 6-fold, respectively, reaching 8.42\u2009±\u20090.52\xa0g/L biomass and \n3.37\u2009±\u20090.55\xa0g/L lipid titer (40% lipid content). Further enhancement through \nPlackett-Burman and Box-Behnken designs led to 11-fold and 16.7-fold \nimprovements, achieving 20.95\u2009±\u20091.2\xa0g/L biomass and 9.35\u2009±\u20090.35\xa0g/L lipid titer \n(44.6% lipid content) from 53.7\u2009±\u20090.29\xa0g/L xylose in a 7-L bioreactor under \ncontrolled pH. A fed-batch fermentation strategy further elevated performance to \n27.0\u2009±\u20091.08\xa0g/L biomass and 13.0\u2009±\u20090.36\xa0g/L lipid titer (48.1% lipid content). \nWhen xylose was replaced with PDW hydrolysate, lipid production increased to \n14.7\u2009±\u20091.14\xa0g/L titer (54.4% lipid content), representing a 26.3-fold \nimprovement over initial conditions. Fatty acid profiling revealed a composition \ndominated by oleic and linoleic acids, with over 54% comprising unsaturated \nfatty acids. Notably, γ-linolenic acid, cis-10-pentadecenoic acid, and \ncis-11-eicosenoic acid rare fatty acids with distinct physicochemical and \nnutraceutical properties were detected, highlighting the strain's potential for \nspecialty lipid production. This study establishes a scalable, statistically \noptimized bioprocess for PDW valorization using an environmental isolate of R. \nglutinis, contributing to circular bioeconomy strategies for sustainable \nmicrobial lipid biomanufacturing.\n\n© 2025.

This study investigates a novel \nvalorization approach by cultivating the oleaginous yeast Rhodotorula glutinis \non OMWW supplemented with CW, a nitrogen-rich dairy byproduct. Four OMWW/CW \nratios (25/75, 50/50, 75/25, 100/0, v/v) were evaluated to assess their impact \non microbial growth, metabolite production, and wastewater remediation. The \n25/75 (v/v) and 50/50 (v/v) mixtures supported the highest biomass yields (>\u20095 \ng\u202fL⁻1 within 3-5 days), while the 50/50 (v/v) mixture led to maximum lipid and \ncarotenoid accumulation after 8 days. Under this condition, substantial \ndepollution was also observed, with near-complete removal of hydroxytyrosol and \ntyrosol as well as significant reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD). \nCarotenoids extracted from R. glutinis showed thermal stability at 60\u202f°C and \nexhibited strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities. These findings \ndemonstrate the feasibility of coupling waste treatment with the production of \nbioactive compounds. The proposed bioprocess valorizes two problematic waste \nstreams into valuable microbial biomass and functional metabolites, with \npotential to reduce environmental impact.\n\n© 2025.

There was a significant association (P = \n0.048) between positive skin cultures and positive blood cultures, but isolates \nobtained were consistently different between paired results. There was no \nsignificant association (P > 0.05) between blood culture results and health \nstatus, evidence of healed or unhealed injuries, external fibropapillomatosis, \nor presence of barnacles. Based on the results of this study, positive blood \ncultures suggestive of nonclinical bacteremia may be present in apparently \nhealthy green turtles. The results of this study will aid the attending \nclinician in interpretation of blood culture results of apparently healthy or \npresumed septicemic captive and rehabilitating green turtles as part of the \nconservation and population recovery of this threatened species.\n\nDOI: 10.1638/2023-0107\nPMID: 39255207 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'},

The tubers with disease severity of 1 to 4 are accepted and stored in \npotato storage for cheap selling in Thailand. However, there are few studies of \nthe bacterial community of the scabby tuber during storage. Thus, we aim to \nelucidate the diversity, structure, and function of the bacterial community of \n30-day storage potato scabby tubers stored in different temperatures using 16S \namplicon metagenomic sequencing. Bacterial communities of storage potato scabby \ntubers (Spunta\xa0cultivar) collected from different storage temperatures, 4\xa0°C \n(MEP1) and 6\xa0°C (MEP2), were characterized using 16S rRNA\xa0amplicon metagenomic \nsequencing. The alpha-diversity abundance in the bacteriome of the scabby tubers \nstored at 6 °C was higher than in those stored at 4 °C. Actinobacteria (34.7%) \nwas a dominant phylum in MEP1, while Proteobacteria (39.9%) was predominant in \nMEP2. The top 10 genera of both communities were Rhizobium group, Streptomyces, \nPectobacterium, Ruminococcus, Cellulomonas, Promicromonospora, Prevotella, \nEnterobacter, Pedobacter, and Paenarthrobacter. Moreover, functional profile \nprediction of both communities reveals essential genes in the pathosystem: nos, \nbglA, and cebEFG-msiK for potato scab disease and phc and peh operons for rot \ndisease. Our findings are the first study to explore details of the bacteriome \nof the accepted potato scabby tubers for selling during storage in Thailand and \nstrongly indicate that although potatoes were stored at low temperatures, \ndiseases still occur by secondary pathogens.\n\n© 2024.

Secondary bacterial infections have been \nsuggested to cause acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (ADLA) attacks and drive \ndisease progression. Although the North West Region of Cameroon has a proven \nhistory of podoconiosis endemicity, the bacterial composition of lymphoedema due \nto this condition has not been studied. Thus, this study investigated the leg \nbacterial diversity of patients who suffered from the lymphoedema and their \nsusceptibility pattern to selected antibiotics.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in which podoconiosis affected \nand non-lymphoedema individuals living in the same community were purposively \nselected. Samples were collected by swabbing the skin between the toes and \naround the anklebone, then cultured and sub-cultured on nutrient agar to obtain \npure isolates. The cultured isolates were then morphologically and biochemically \nclassified using microscopy and analytic profile index test kits, respectively. \nThe disk diffusion technique was used to determine antibiotic susceptibility.\nRESULTS: Thirty-three participants were recruited, and 249 bacterial isolates \nwere characterized into 29 genera, 60 species; with 30 (50%) being gram positive \nrods, 19 (31.7%) gram positive cocci, and 11 (18.3%) gram negative rods. \nThirteen gram positive rods, fifteen gram positive cocci, and eight gram \nnegative rods of bacterial species were found only in podoconiosis individuals \namong which Cellulomonas spp / Microbacterium spp. (2.8%), Staphylococcus lentus \n(3.3%), and Burkholderia cepacia (4.0%) dominated. 90% (90%) of the bacterial \nisolates were sensitive to doxycycline, whereas ampicillin had a high level of \nintermediate resistance, and penicillin G had the greatest resistant profile.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings show that 94 (37.8%) out of 249 described bacterial \nisolates were exclusively found in the legs of podoconiosis individuals, and \ntheir susceptibility pattern to antibiotics was similar to that of others.\n\n© 2023.

This community exhibited the capacity \nfor aerobic anoxygenic phototrophy, carbon and nitrogen fixation, and sulfur \ncycling, processes vital for survival in nutrient-poor environments. 52 \nhigh-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered, representing \nboth transient and cosmopolitan taxa, some of which were able to rapidly respond \nto environmental changes. A diverse and highly dynamic collection of lytic and \ntemperate viruses was identified across all samples, with high clonal viral \ngenomes typically detected in only one of the eight samples analyzed. \nMetatranscriptomic analyses confirmed the activity of lytic viruses, while \nprophage genomes featured much lower expression levels. Prophages appeared to \ninfluence host fitness through the expression of genes encoding membrane \ntransporters.

The BCP system \nachieved a maximum nitrate removal efficiency of 97.3\u202f%, significantly \noutperforming the single PHBV system (91.05\u202f%), while effectively reducing \nnitrous oxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. It also demonstrated stable \ncarbon release and enhanced electron transfer capabilities, contributing to a \nmore sustainable denitrification process. The physical and chemical \ncharacterization of BCP confirmed that its superior performance is attributed to \nthe uniformly distributed functional groups (e.g., CO and -COOH) on the surface \nand its porous structure, which facilitated electron transfer and microbial \nadhesion. Metagenomic and microbial analyses further revealed that BCP enriched \nfunctional genera such as Cellulomonas and Chryseobacterium and significantly \nincreased the abundance of key functional genes related to nitrate reduction \n(e.g., NaR and NiR), enhancing organic matter decomposition and microbial \nnitrogen transformation. Beyond improving nitrate removal efficiency compared to \nPHBV, the BCP material offers practical engineering value by addressing carbon \nsource limitations in long-term wastewater treatment applications. Its enhanced \nelectron transfer and microbial enrichment suggest strong potential for \napplication in constructed wetlands, biofilters, and other decentralized \nwastewater treatment systems.

Genome mining \nhas revealed many predicted siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in \nbacterial genomes, however the structures of their siderophore products remain \nmostly undetermined. This limits our molecular-level understanding of how \nbacteria acquire iron, as well as how they interact with other taxa that may use \nthe same siderophores within bacterial communities. Here, we apply inverse \nstable isotope labeling (InverSIL) to rapidly connect predicted siderophore BGCs \nto their products. With InverSIL, bacteria are grown on 13C-substituted carbon \nsources and then fed predicted biosynthetic precursors at their natural isotopic \nabundance to identify BGC products by mass spectrometry, which removes issues \nwith the availability of isotopically substituted precursors. We use InverSIL to \ndetermine the structures of the siderophore products of predicted BGCs from the \nmethylotrophic genera Methylophilus and Methylobacterium, and the siderophores \nproduced by the opportunistic pathogen Chromobacterium violaceum, which were \npreviously shown to be essential for virulence yet remained structurally \nuncharacterized. We next use this approach to reveal the unexpected production \nof enterobactin by the genera Kushneria and Paracoccus, which was difficult to \npredict from genome sequences due to the distributed nature of the biosynthetic \ngenes within the genomes. Finally, we use InverSIL to discover new siderophores, \ncellulochelin A and B, from the cellulose-degrading plant symbiont Cellulomonas \nsp. strain Leaf334. These findings demonstrate the utility of InverSIL for \nfunctional BGC characterization and expand our molecular understanding of \nbacterial iron acquisition strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.1101/2025.11.05.686764\nPMCID: PMC12637720\nPMID: 41280040\n\nConflict of interest statement: CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no \nconflicts of interest.'},

To determine the key \ndrivers of this process and their vulnerability to climate change, the \nshort-term responses of these pioneering microbial communities also need to be \nelucidated. Here, we investigated how the taxonomic and functional structure of \nmicrobial communities, including viruses, changed over a 7-year period in an \nAntarctic glacier forefield. Using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics we \nassessed the influence of both abiotic and biotic factors on these communities. \nOur results revealed a highly heterogeneous bacteria-dominated microbial \ncommunity, with Pseudomonas as the most abundant genus, followed by Lysobacter, \nDevosia, Cellulomonas, and Brevundimonas. This community exhibited the capacity \nfor aerobic anoxygenic phototrophy, carbon and nitrogen fixation, and sulfur \ncycling, processes vital for survival in nutrient-poor environments. 52 \nhigh-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered, representing \nboth transient and cosmopolitan taxa, some of which were able to rapidly respond \nto environmental changes. A diverse and highly dynamic collection of lytic and \ntemperate viruses was identified across all samples, with high clonal viral \ngenomes typically detected in only one of the eight samples analyzed. \nMetatranscriptomic analyses confirmed the activity of lytic viruses, while \nprophage genomes featured much lower expression levels. Prophages appeared to \ninfluence host fitness through the expression of genes encoding membrane \ntransporters. Additionally, the abundance of genes linked to antimicrobial \ncompound synthesis and resistance, along with antiphage defense systems, \nhighlights the importance of biotic interactions in driving microbial community \nsuccession and shaping short-term responses to environmental fluctuations.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

The BCP system \nachieved a maximum nitrate removal efficiency of 97.3\u202f%, significantly \noutperforming the single PHBV system (91.05\u202f%), while effectively reducing \nnitrous oxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. It also demonstrated stable \ncarbon release and enhanced electron transfer capabilities, contributing to a \nmore sustainable denitrification process. The physical and chemical \ncharacterization of BCP confirmed that its superior performance is attributed to \nthe uniformly distributed functional groups (e.g., CO and -COOH) on the surface \nand its porous structure, which facilitated electron transfer and microbial \nadhesion. Metagenomic and microbial analyses further revealed that BCP enriched \nfunctional genera such as Cellulomonas and Chryseobacterium and significantly \nincreased the abundance of key functional genes related to nitrate reduction \n(e.g., NaR and NiR), enhancing organic matter decomposition and microbial \nnitrogen transformation. Beyond improving nitrate removal efficiency compared to \nPHBV, the BCP material offers practical engineering value by addressing carbon \nsource limitations in long-term wastewater treatment applications. Its enhanced \nelectron transfer and microbial enrichment suggest strong potential for \napplication in constructed wetlands, biofilters, and other decentralized \nwastewater treatment systems.

This \nstudy investigated the bacterial etiology, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and \nrisk factors in childhood diarrhea in Nairobi, Kenya.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 216 children aged 0-60 \nmonths presenting with diarrhea at hospitals in Nairobi County. Stool samples \nwere cultured and isolates tested against eight antibiotics. Caregiver \nquestionnaires assessed risk factors. Associations were evaluated using Fisher's \nexact test and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to determine effect sizes.\nRESULTS: A total of 204 bacterial isolates were recovered. Escherichia coli was \nthe most frequent (38.2%), followed by Shigella sonnei (11.8%) and Enterobacter \ncloacae (9.8%). The overall prevalence of enteric bacterial infection was 94.4%. \nKey risk factors significantly associated with infection included the absence of \nconsistent soap availability (OR: 7.4, 95% CI: 3.7-15.0), visible poor \nsanitation (OR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.7-13.8), and lack of safe drinking water (OR: \n12.9, 95% CI: 1.7-98.9). AMR was widespread, with 82.8% of isolates resistant to \nat least one antibiotic and 58.3% classified as multidrug-resistant (MDR). High \nresistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid was common, exceeding \n70% in key pathogens like E. coli and E. cloacae. In contrast, meropenem, \namikacin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin retained near-complete efficacy.\nCONCLUSION: Childhood diarrhea in Nairobi is predominantly bacterial, driven by \ndiverse pathogens and exacerbated by poor hygiene and alarmingly high AMR. \nUrgent integrated interventions are needed, including strengthening WASH \ninfrastructure, promoting rational antibiotic use, and enhancing AMR \nsurveillance. These findings provide a critical baseline for public health \naction and underscore the need to safeguard last-line antibiotics.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Davis Kimile et al.

AMR genes in bacteria are often carried on mobile \nelements, such as plasmids. The horizontal movement of plasmids allows AMR genes \nand resistance to key therapeutics to disseminate in a population. However, the \nquantification of the movement of plasmids remains challenging with existing \ncomputational approaches. Here, we introduce a novel method that allows us to \nreconstruct and quantify the movement of plasmids in bacterial populations over \ntime. To do so, we model chromosomal and plasmid DNA co-evolution using a joint \ncoalescent and plasmid transfer process in a Bayesian phylogenetic network \napproach. This approach reconstructs differences in the evolutionary history of \nplasmids and chromosomes to reconstruct instances where plasmids likely move \nbetween bacterial lineages while accounting for parameter uncertainty. We apply \nthis new approach to a five-year dataset of Shigella, exploring the plasmid \ntransfer rates of five different plasmids with different AMR and virulence \nprofiles. In doing so, we reconstruct the co-evolution of the large Shigella \nvirulence plasmid with the chromosome DNA. We quantify higher plasmid transfer \nrates of three small plasmids that move between lineages of Shigella sonnei. \nFinally, we determine the recent dissemination of a multidrug-resistant plasmid \nbetween S. sonnei and S. flexneri lineages in multiple independent events and \nthrough steady growth in prevalence since 2010. This approach has a strong \npotential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of \nAMR-carrying plasmids as they are introduced, circulate, and are maintained in \nbacterial populations.\n\nCopyright: © 2025 Müller et al.

All samples \nwere cultured on the xylose lysine desoxycholate agar and hektoen enteric agar \nand incubated at 37\xa0°C for 24\xa0h. Primary identification of the Shigella species \nwas performed by biochemical tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). \nAntibiotic resistance rates were evaluated by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion. \nThe prevalence of 12 CRISPR-Cas genes was investigated by PCR.\nRESULTS: Overall, 83 Shigella isolates were identified by standard biochemical \ntests. Finally, 72 Shigella isolates including 45 S. flexneri (46.8%) and 27 \n(53.2%) S. sonnei were confirmed by PCR. The most effective antibiotics were \ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (n\u2009=\u200948, 66.7%), imipenem (n\u2009=\u200946, 63.9%), and \nceftazidime (n\u2009=\u200943, 59.7%), respectively.

This study examines the prevalence of \nESBL-producing isolates and the presence of blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, intI1, and \nintI2 genes among Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri isolates from children \nwith diarrhea in Shiraz, southwest Iran. From October 2019 to March 2020, 50 S. \nflexneri and 50 S. sonnei were isolated from children under 13 years old with \ndiarrhea. Antimicrobial susceptibility and ESBL production were assessed, and \nthe presence of ESBL-mediated genes, also intI1 and intI2 genes, was \ninvestigated using polymerase chain reaction methods. Resistance rates of 100% \nwere observed against cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, and \ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in all S. flexneri and S. sonnei isolates, with \nall isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR). ESBL positivity was found in \n(68%) of S. flexneri and (64%) of S. sonnei isolates. The blaCTX-M gene was \nprevalent in (56%) of S. flexneri and (70%) of S. sonnei isolates. Remarkably, \nintI1 and intI2 were detected in (80%) and (86%) of S. flexneri isolates and \n(18%) and (90%) of S. sonnei isolates, respectively. In conclusion, the \nincreasing resistance to first- and second-line antibiotics for treating \nshigellosis in Iran is a significant concern. The high prevalence of MDR \nShigella spp. isolates in our region underscores the critical need to address \nthe spread of antibiotic resistance and integrons in Shigella spp., making it an \nurgent priority.\n\n© 2025.

Here, we report the isolation and characterization of \na novel lytic phage, SSG23, effective against four major Shigella serovars. \nPhage SSG23 possesses a prolate head and contractile tail, consistent with the \nStraboviridae family, and remains stable across a broad pH (4-11) and \ntemperature range (-20 °C to 50 °C). It exhibits a latent period of 37\u2009minutes, \na burst size of 195 plaque-forming units per cell, and a 168,820\u2009bp dsDNA genome \nwith 40.8% GC content lacking resistance or toxin genes. SSG23 efficiently \ndegrades biofilms, alone or with antibiotics, and is non-toxic to macrophages in \nvitro. In S. sonnei-infected BALB/c mice, oral administration reduced bacterial \ncolonization and shedding while improving health without evidence of resistance \nemergence. Neutralizing antibodies developed in mice, yet the phage maintained \nits efficacy. These findings support SSG23 as a promising candidate for phage \ntherapy against Shigella infection.\n\n© 2025.

Ferrate (Fe(VI)), a strong and \neco-friendly oxidant, shows great potential for this purpose. This study \nsystematically evaluated the efficacy of Fe(VI) in mitigating ARGs and ARB in \nanaerobically digested sludge, with a particular focus on elucidating the \nunderlying mechanisms by which Fe(VI) effects ARGs dissemination through both \nvertical gene transfer (VGT) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Result shows \nthat Fe(VI) doses of 20 and 60\u202fmg/g-TS reduce ARGs by 9.75\u202f% and 19.12\u202f%, \nrespectively, while inactivating up to 24.7\u202f% of ARB at the higher dose. \nPathogenic ARB, such as Escherichia coli and Shigella sonnei, are preferentially \nremoved, with abundances decrease by 63.7\u202f% and 28.0\u202f%. Mechanistically, the \nstructural disruption of bacterial cells caused by Fe(VI) in anaerobically \ndigested sludge, as indicated by a 29\u202f% reduction in extracellular polymeric \nsubstances and a 23.7\u202f% increase in cell membrane permeability. Subsequently, a \nmarked release of intracellular ARGs into the extracellular environment is also \nobserved, where they are likely subjected to degradation by Fe(VI). This \noxidative killing accounts for the observed ARB decrease, thereby limiting the \nVGT of ARGs. In addition, Fe(VI) impairs the HGT of ARGs by diminishing their \nmobility potential, reflected in the reduced co-occurence with mobile genetic \nelements. Meanwhile, sludge bacterial competence for DNA uptake and \nrecombination is markedly reduced, as evidenced by a 9.8\u202f% decline in the \nabundance of related functional genes. These findings demonstrate that Fe(VI) \neffectively inhibits the dissemination of ARGs by targeting both primary \ntransmission pathways. It suppresses VGT, thereby reducing the inheritance of \nARB within populations, and limits HGT, curbing the spread of mobile ARGs among \ncompetent species. By disrupting these two critical routes, Fe(VI) shows strong \npotential as an effective strategy for mitigating ARGs propagation in sludge \nsystems.\n\nCopyright © 2025.

Both species are capable of forming bacterial biofilms \nin the food processing industry, a key survival mechanism that significantly \nreduces the effectiveness of antibacterial drugs. The global rise in \nantimicrobial resistance (AMR) necessitates the urgent development of new \nstrategies. Bacteriophages, particularly phage cocktails, provide a potential \nalternative because of their host specificity and ability to degrade biofilms.\nRESULTS: In this study, a new bacteriophage, Sspk23, infecting Shigella sonnei, \nwas isolated from lake water and biologically characterized to assess its lytic \nactivity and stability under varying conditions. Furthermore, this study \ninvestigates the effectiveness of a phage cocktail, including a newly isolated \nSspk23 and two previously identified phages, Sfk20 and STWB21, against Shigella \nand Salmonella infections with a focus on its ability to combat single and \npolymicrobial infections. The biofilm removal potential of the phage cocktail \nwas observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Confocal Laser \nScanning Microscopy (CLSM), and also quantitatively assessed in a microtiter \nplate. Cytotoxicity tests were conducted on human adherent epithelial cell line \nand macrophage cell line to confirm the safety of the phage and phage cocktail \nfor therapeutic use.\nCONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the possibility of a phage cocktail as a \nsubstitute for conventional antibiotics in controlling Shigella and Salmonella \ninfections. Additionally, their capacity to destroy biofilms indicates potential \napplications in clinical therapies, environmental remediation, and food safety. \nFuture studies will be focused on phage-antibiotic synergy optimization and in \nvivo validation to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria.\n\n© 2025.

The optimum parameter set (time, temperature, pH, sugar) for the production \nof EPS was determined. The highest yield was obtained at a temperature of 39\xa0°C, \na pH range of 8-10, and using mannose (0.2%) as the carbon source. The results \nof FT-IR and the NMR analysis revealed that the EPS is a mixture of hexoses with \npossible pentose sugars. Moreover, this structure showed positive antibiofilm \nactivity against five pathogenic bacteria; Acinetobacter sp., Staphylococcus \naureus, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella sp., and Shigella flexneri, as well as \nantioxidant activity (42%). Furthermore, the high water-holding (355%) and \noil-holding capacity (170%) of the EPS may enhance the nutritional value and \nrheological characteristics of food products. The improved emulsifying activity \nof mustard oil suggested potential use for stabilizing emulsions. Additionally, \nthe EPS showed promising flocculating activity, indicating its potential \napplication in treatment of industrial wastewater.

This study examines the prevalence of \nESBL-producing isolates and the presence of blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, intI1, and \nintI2 genes among Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri isolates from children \nwith diarrhea in Shiraz, southwest Iran. From October 2019 to March 2020, 50 S. \nflexneri and 50 S. sonnei were isolated from children under 13 years old with \ndiarrhea. Antimicrobial susceptibility and ESBL production were assessed, and \nthe presence of ESBL-mediated genes, also intI1 and intI2 genes, was \ninvestigated using polymerase chain reaction methods. Resistance rates of 100% \nwere observed against cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, and \ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in all S. flexneri and S. sonnei isolates, with \nall isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR). ESBL positivity was found in \n(68%) of S. flexneri and (64%) of S. sonnei isolates. The blaCTX-M gene was \nprevalent in (56%) of S. flexneri and (70%) of S. sonnei isolates. Remarkably, \nintI1 and intI2 were detected in (80%) and (86%) of S. flexneri isolates and \n(18%) and (90%) of S. sonnei isolates, respectively. In conclusion, the \nincreasing resistance to first- and second-line antibiotics for treating \nshigellosis in Iran is a significant concern.

S. sonnei is divided into five \nmonophyletic lineages, yet most infections are caused by a few clonal \nsub-lineages within Lineage 3 that are quite distinct from the widely used \nLineage 2 laboratory strain 53G. Factors underlying the success of these \nglobally dominant lineages remain unclear in part due to a lack of complete \ngenome sequences and animal models. Here, we utilise a novel reference \ncollection of representative Lineage 1, 2 and 3 isolates and find that \nepidemiologically successful S. sonnei harbour fewer genes encoding putative \nimmunogenic components whilst key virulence-associated regions (including the \ntype three secretion system and O-antigen) remain highly conserved. Using a \nzebrafish infection model, Lineage 3 isolates proved most virulent, driven by \nincreased dissemination and a greater neutrophil response. These isolates also \nshow increased resistance to complement-mediated killing alongside upregulated \nexpression of group four capsule synthesis genes. Consistently, primary human \nneutrophil infections revealed an increased tolerance to phagosomal killing. \nTogether, our findings link the epidemiological success of S. sonnei to \nheightened virulence and stress tolerance, and highlight zebrafish as a valuable \nplatform to illuminate factors underlying establishment of epidemiological \nsuccess.\n\n© 2025.

However, it is unclear how Shigella effectively survives in the presence \nof bile salts. Here, we report that the biofilm formation and pathogenicity of \nS. sonnei are induced by primary bile salts through the two-component system \nEvgS/EvgA. The response regulator EvgA controls the transcription of the cyclic \nAMP synthase-encoding gene. Furthermore, the effector protein CRP of the cyclic \nAMP (cAMP) signal not only positively controls the transcription of ydeH, a gene \nencoding cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) synthase, but also forms a complex with YdeH \nto improve its catalytic production of c-di-GMP. Additionally, interacting with \nYdeH enhances the ability of CRP to bind to the promoter of ydeH. Our work \nprovides insights into how S. sonnei utilizes cascade amplification of c-di-GMP \nto promote fitness and pathogenicity in response to primary bile salts.\n\nCopyright © 2025 The Author(s).

To explore \nhost genetic-microbiota interactions and their clinical implications, we \nanalyzed the urinary microbiota (urobiota) and conducted genome-wide association \nstudies (GWAS) for bacterial abundance traits in pediatric UTI and VUR patients \nfrom the RIVUR and CUTIE cohorts. We identified four urobiota community types \nbased on relative abundance, characterized by the genera Enterococcus, \nPrevotella, Pseudomonas, and Escherichia/Shigella, and their associations with \nVUR, age, and toilet training. Children with VUR exhibited decreased microbial \ndiversity and increased abundance of genera that included opportunistic \npathogens, suggesting a disrupted urobiota. We detected genome-wide significant \ngenetic associations with urinary bacterial relative abundances, in or near \ncandidate genes including CXCL12, ABCC1, and ROBO1, which are implicated in \nurinary tract development and response to infection. We showed that Cxcl12 is \ninduced 12 hours after uropathogenic bacterial infection in mouse bladder. The \nassociation with CXCL12 suggests a genetic link between UTI, VUR and \ncardiovascular phenotypes later in life. These findings provide the first \ncharacterization of host genetic influences on the pediatric urobiota in UTI and \nVUR, offering insights into the interplay between disease, host genetics and the \nurobiota composition.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.199689\nPMID: 41364520"},

This study investigated the role of phages in \nmodulating the prevalence and seasonal patterns of major diarrheal pathogens, \nVibrio cholerae O1 (VCO1), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Shigella \nspp., and Salmonella spp. in diarrheal patients and environmental wastewater \nspecimens collected from six different sites in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2024. \nVCO1, ETEC, Shigella, and Salmonella were detected in 10.1%, 7.8%, 1.7%, and \n2.4% of diarrheal specimens, respectively. In contrast, phages targeting these \npathogens were more frequently isolated, with detection rates of 20% for VCO1, \n30% for ETEC, 57% for Shigella, and 9.2% for Salmonella-specific phages. Adults \nshowed a significantly higher burden of VCO1 and corresponding phages compared \nwith children <5 years (P < 0.001). Seasonal analysis revealed significant \ncorrelations between VCO1 (37.3%) and corresponding phages (57.6%) peaking in \nlate September in both clinical (r = 0.53, P < 0.0001) and environmental \nwastewater specimens (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The highest correlation (r = 0.68) \nwas found between the increased rate of wastewater phages in the preceding week \nand a rise in cholera cases in the following week. ETEC and ETEC phages isolated \nfrom wastewater also showed strong correlations (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). \nCross-specificity analysis demonstrated that VCO1 phages were highly specific to \ntheir targets, whereas ETEC and Shigella phages exhibited broader host ranges, \nwith some Shigella phages capable of infecting ETEC and Salmonella spp. Overall, \nthese findings support the hypothesis that Vibrio phages could serve as an \nalternative or complementary tool for cholera \nsurveillance.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the dynamics between phages and their \nbacterial hosts is critical for elucidating disease burden; however, their \npotential for surveillance remains underexplored. To our knowledge, this is the \nfirst study that longitudinally investigated major diarrheal pathogens and their \nphages in both clinical and environmental sources to assess the potential of \nbacteriophages as a tool to improve diarrheal surveillance. The high frequency \nof phages compared to the host bacterial counterparts suggests a valuable, yet \nunderutilized, role for phages in surveillance systems. Strong seasonal \nalignment between V. cholerae O1 and its phages, both peaking in late September, \nsuggests that phage dynamics may reflect pathogen transmission. These \npreliminary observations raise the possibility that wastewater-derived Vibrio \nphages could function as early indicators of cholera burden. Future research \nshould aim to explore the complex and poorly understood interactions between \nphages and their bacterial hosts, particularly how these dynamics shape pathogen \npopulations in endemic settings.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.02654-25\nPMID: 41363802'},

While the primary \nreservoirs of Shigella are historically recognized as humans and non-human \nprimates, emerging evidence indicates an expanding host range encompassing \ndiverse animal species. This study systematically characterizes a Shigella sp. \nstrain isolated from diarrheic suckling mice.\nMETHODS: Diarrheic suckling mice intestinal contents were collected and analyzed \nusing 16S rRNA sequencing technology. Shigella sp. JZ001 strain was isolated, \npurified, and identified. Bacterial morphology was examined by transmission \nelectron microscopy. Carbon source utilization profiles were determined using \nBIOLOG GENIII MicroPlates™. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition was \nquantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) following \nmethyl-tert-butyl ether extraction. Polar lipid analysis was performed through \ntwo-dimensional thin-layer chromatography with detection using 10% ethanolic \nmolybdatophosphoric acid. Whole genome sequencing was performed using a hybrid \napproach combining Illumina NovaSeq and Nanopore MinION platforms. Phylogenetic \nreconstruction was performed using maximum-likelihood algorithms implemented in \nMEGA.\nRESULTS: Rotavirus-SA11 infected suckling mice exhibited watery feces 4\u202fdays \npost-infection. Intestinal contents were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing \ntechnology, which revealed a significant increase in the genus Shigella in the \nRV-infected group. A Shigella strain was isolated and purified from the \nintestinal contents and designated as JZ001. Polyphasic characterization \nconfirmed that strain JZ001 belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family and is \nphylogenetically closest to Shigella spp. The genome consists of a single \ncircular chromosome (5,329,126 bp; G\u202f+\u202fC content 50.65%) and one plasmid \n(1,09829 bp, G\u202f+\u202fC content 40.14%). Comparative genomic analysis identified 24 \nSalmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-like regions. Substrate assimilation tests \ndemonstrated metabolic versatility, including utilization of D-Maltose, \nD-Trehalose, α-D-Glucose, D-Mannose, D-Fructose, D-Galactose and Propionic Acid. \nCellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis identified predominant \ncomponents as: Dodecanoic acid (12:0; 11.08%), Tetradecanoic acid (14:0; \n12.00%), Hexadecanoic acid (16:0; 21.55%), cycloheptadecanoic acid (17:0 cyclo; \n13.99%), Dodecanal (12:0 aldehyde; 22.32%).

This study investigated the role of phages in \nmodulating the prevalence and seasonal patterns of major diarrheal pathogens, \nVibrio cholerae O1 (VCO1), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Shigella \nspp., and Salmonella spp. in diarrheal patients and environmental wastewater \nspecimens collected from six different sites in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2024. \nVCO1, ETEC, Shigella, and Salmonella were detected in 10.1%, 7.8%, 1.7%, and \n2.4% of diarrheal specimens, respectively. In contrast, phages targeting these \npathogens were more frequently isolated, with detection rates of 20% for VCO1, \n30% for ETEC, 57% for Shigella, and 9.2% for Salmonella-specific phages. Adults \nshowed a significantly higher burden of VCO1 and corresponding phages compared \nwith children <5 years (P < 0.001). Seasonal analysis revealed significant \ncorrelations between VCO1 (37.3%) and corresponding phages (57.6%) peaking in \nlate September in both clinical (r = 0.53, P < 0.0001) and environmental \nwastewater specimens (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). The highest correlation (r = 0.68) \nwas found between the increased rate of wastewater phages in the preceding week \nand a rise in cholera cases in the following week. ETEC and ETEC phages isolated \nfrom wastewater also showed strong correlations (r = 0.65, P < 0.001). \nCross-specificity analysis demonstrated that VCO1 phages were highly specific to \ntheir targets, whereas ETEC and Shigella phages exhibited broader host ranges, \nwith some Shigella phages capable of infecting ETEC and Salmonella spp. Overall, \nthese findings support the hypothesis that Vibrio phages could serve as an \nalternative or complementary tool for cholera \nsurveillance.IMPORTANCEUnderstanding the dynamics between phages and their \nbacterial hosts is critical for elucidating disease burden; however, their \npotential for surveillance remains underexplored. To our knowledge, this is the \nfirst study that longitudinally investigated major diarrheal pathogens and their \nphages in both clinical and environmental sources to assess the potential of \nbacteriophages as a tool to improve diarrheal surveillance. The high frequency \nof phages compared to the host bacterial counterparts suggests a valuable, yet \nunderutilized, role for phages in surveillance systems. Strong seasonal \nalignment between V. cholerae O1 and its phages, both peaking in late September, \nsuggests that phage dynamics may reflect pathogen transmission. These \npreliminary observations raise the possibility that wastewater-derived Vibrio \nphages could function as early indicators of cholera burden. Future research \nshould aim to explore the complex and poorly understood interactions between \nphages and their bacterial hosts, particularly how these dynamics shape pathogen \npopulations in endemic settings.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.02654-25\nPMID: 41363802'},

Factors contributing to these \noutbreaks include improper food storage, inadequate hygiene during food \npreparation, and environmental contamination. This descriptive-analytical study \naimed to investigate the epidemiology and time series modeling of waterborne and \nfoodborne disease outbreaks in West Azerbaijan Province from Jan 2016 to Dec \n2023.\nMETHODS: Data recorded in the health deputy's portal system were utilized for \nanalysis. The variables examined included age, sex, number of patients, \nhospitalizations, fatalities, presenting symptoms, and spatial and geographical \ndata related to the outbreaks. Box-Jenkins models were employed for time series \nanalysis. Descriptive statistics were computed using SPSS 26 software, while \nmodeling was conducted using R Studio 2021.09.2 and Minitab 22.2.1 software.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 1306 outbreaks were reported, resulting in \n2686 cases of illness, 792 hospitalizations, and 7 fatalities. The causative \nagent of waterborne and foodborne outbreaks was identified through laboratory \ntesting in 43% the cases.

The development \nof new antibiotics is slow and challenging, underscoring the need for \nalternative therapeutic strategies. One promising approach involves leveraging \ngut microbiota-derived bacteria that confer colonization resistance against \nenteric pathogens. In this study, we screened a human gut microbiota culture \ncollection and identified Bifidobacterium longum as the most effective species \nin inhibiting S. Typhimurium and S. flexneri in vitro. To evaluate its \nprotective potential in vivo, we utilized Caenorhabditis elegans as a model \nsystem. Our findings demonstrate that B. longum significantly reduced pathogen \nburden and enhanced host survival following infection. Mechanistic analysis \nrevealed that B. longum inhibits S. Typhimurium primarily through acidification, \nwhile S. flexneri suppression appears to involve a protein-mediated or \nheat-stable metabolite-dependent mechanism. Additionally, B. longum modulated \nhost immune pathways, downregulating genes associated with the p38 MAPK and \ninsulin/IGF-1 signaling pathways. These results highlight the potential of B. \nlongum as a non-antibiotic therapeutic for controlling Salmonella and Shigella \ninfections. However, further validation in mammalian models is required to \nassess its clinical relevance.\nIMPORTANCE: Gut infections caused by Salmonella and Shigella are major global \nhealth threats. As an alternative to novel drug discovery, which is \ntime-consuming and faces several challenges, this study explores the potential \nof gut bacteria to protect against these pathogens. We identified \nBifidobacterium longum, a common gut microbe, which can significantly reduce \ninfection by both Salmonella and Shigella in a lab setting and in a simple \nanimal model. The bacterium functions by creating an environment that is hostile \nto pathogens and by modulating the host's immune responses. These findings \nsuggest that B. longum could be developed as a natural, non-antibiotic treatment \nto control or reduce these enteric pathogen infections. This approach opens the \ndoor to using probiotics as effective tools in the global fight against \nantibiotic resistance.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/spectrum.01842-25\nPMID: 41347508"},

While the primary \nreservoirs of Shigella are historically recognized as humans and non-human \nprimates, emerging evidence indicates an expanding host range encompassing \ndiverse animal species. This study systematically characterizes a Shigella sp. \nstrain isolated from diarrheic suckling mice.\nMETHODS: Diarrheic suckling mice intestinal contents were collected and analyzed \nusing 16S rRNA sequencing technology. Shigella sp. JZ001 strain was isolated, \npurified, and identified. Bacterial morphology was examined by transmission \nelectron microscopy. Carbon source utilization profiles were determined using \nBIOLOG GENIII MicroPlates™. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition was \nquantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) following \nmethyl-tert-butyl ether extraction. Polar lipid analysis was performed through \ntwo-dimensional thin-layer chromatography with detection using 10% ethanolic \nmolybdatophosphoric acid. Whole genome sequencing was performed using a hybrid \napproach combining Illumina NovaSeq and Nanopore MinION platforms. Phylogenetic \nreconstruction was performed using maximum-likelihood algorithms implemented in \nMEGA.\nRESULTS: Rotavirus-SA11 infected suckling mice exhibited watery feces 4\u202fdays \npost-infection. Intestinal contents were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing \ntechnology, which revealed a significant increase in the genus Shigella in the \nRV-infected group. A Shigella strain was isolated and purified from the \nintestinal contents and designated as JZ001. Polyphasic characterization \nconfirmed that strain JZ001 belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family and is \nphylogenetically closest to Shigella spp. The genome consists of a single \ncircular chromosome (5,329,126 bp; G\u202f+\u202fC content 50.65%) and one plasmid \n(1,09829 bp, G\u202f+\u202fC content 40.14%). Comparative genomic analysis identified 24 \nSalmonella pathogenicity island (SPI)-like regions. Substrate assimilation tests \ndemonstrated metabolic versatility, including utilization of D-Maltose, \nD-Trehalose, α-D-Glucose, D-Mannose, D-Fructose, D-Galactose and Propionic Acid. \nCellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis identified predominant \ncomponents as: Dodecanoic acid (12:0; 11.08%), Tetradecanoic acid (14:0; \n12.00%), Hexadecanoic acid (16:0; 21.55%), cycloheptadecanoic acid (17:0 cyclo; \n13.99%), Dodecanal (12:0 aldehyde; 22.32%).

However, the compositional and functional \ncharacteristics of microbial dysbiosis in T1D remain incompletely understood. \nThis study aimed to comprehensively characterize gut microbial alterations and \nassociated metabolic shifts in individuals with T1D.\nMETHODS: The present study is based on re-analysis of publicly available 16S \nrRNA sequencing and fecal untargeted metabolomics data from T1D patients and \nhealthy controls generated by Yuan et al. (2022, Nature Communications). \nMicrobial diversity was assessed using Chao1 and Fisher indices (alpha \ndiversity), and Bray-Curtis-based Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) (beta \ndiversity). Taxonomic differences were examined at phylum, genus, and species \nlevels, and differentially abundant taxa were identified via Linear Discriminant \nAnalysis Effect Size (LEfSe). Correlation analyses were conducted to explore \nmicrobe-metabolite interactions.\nRESULTS: T1D individuals exhibited reduced alpha diversity and distinct beta \ndiversity clustering compared to controls, indicating substantial shifts in \nmicrobial richness and community structure. Taxonomic analysis revealed an \nincreased abundance of Escherichia-Shigella, Veillonella atypica, and \nErysipeloclostridium ramosum in T1D, and depletion of beneficial taxa such as \nBifidobacterium, Parabacteroides distasonis, Alistipes putredinis, and \nBacteroides plebeius. LEfSe analysis confirmed these patterns and highlighted a \nT1D-specific microbial signature. Integrative correlation analysis uncovered \nfunctional dysbiosis, wherein depleted commensals were positively associated \nwith anti-inflammatory and bioenergetic metabolites (e.g., D-gluconic acid, \nlactic acid, pyruvate), while T1D-enriched taxa were linked to metabolites \ninvolved in oxidative stress and immune activation.\nCONCLUSION: Our study reveals profound structural and functional alterations in \nthe gut microbiome of individuals with T1D. These findings support the existence \nof a gut microbial-metabolite axis in autoimmune diabetes and suggest that \nmicrobial biomarkers and metabolic pathways may serve as novel targets for early \ndiagnosis and therapeutic intervention.

Notably, the microbial composition of peritoneal fluid showed the \ngreatest similarity to that of cystic fluid, and functional prediction analyses \nindicated largely overlapping biological functions between these two sites. \nFurthermore, Spearman correlation analysis revealed significant associations \nbetween specific microbial taxa and certain clinical manifestations or \ninflammatory factors.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the presence of a unique and highly diverse \nmicrobiome within the cystic fluid of ovarian endometrioma. The site-specific \nmicrobial profiles and their correlations with clinical parameters suggest a \npotential role of microbiota in disease pathogenesis through inflammatory and \nmetabolic mechanisms. These findings contribute novel insights that may inform \nfuture strategies for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian \nendometrioma.\n\n© 2025.

Among these, SEN virus (SENV) stands out as a \nsignificant concern due to its association with transfusion-induced non-A to \nnon-E hepatitis. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the prevalence of \nthis virus in hemophilia patients, focusing on potential complications and risk \nfactors.\nMETHOD: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a hemophilia center in the \neast of Iran. Blood samples were taken from patients and healthy people, and \ndemographic and clinical information was collected. The sera samples were then \nsubjected to DNA extraction. PCR-based methods detected SENV and its genotype, \nand then phylogenetic analysis was performed. The collected data were analyzed \nand interpreted by SPSS22 software.\nRESULTS: The mean age of patients and the healthy group was 26.18\xa0±\xa014.97 and \n41.69\xa0±\xa014.05, respectively. Among the patient and healthy groups, 94.5\xa0% and \n36.4\xa0% were male, and the rest were female, respectively. Most of the \nparticipants in the patient group had hemophilia type A (85.5\xa0%), then type B \n(7.3\xa0%), VWD type (3.6\xa0%), and F and plt type (1.8\xa0%) were in the next \ncategories. SENV-DNA was detected in 58.2\xa0% of patients and 20\xa0% of healthy \ngroups (P-value: 0.00). Among these, H and D genotypes were found in 35\xa0% and \n23.7\xa0% of patients and 12.7\xa0% and 7.3\xa0% of healthy groups, respectively. The \nprevalence of the virus was significantly related to minor elevation of AST and \nwas higher in hemophilia type A (63.8\xa0%) and severe type of disease (63.2\xa0%).\nCONCLUSION: This study underscore the significant prevalence of the SENV virus \nin hemophilia patients, a particularly noteworthy finding compared to the \nhealthy population. With the limited information available about this virus, our \nfindings highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and follow-up of \nhigh-risk groups in relation to blood-borne pathogens, providing reassurance \nabout the ongoing efforts in the field.\n\n© 2024 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1016/j.nmni.2024.101470\nPMCID: PMC11402639\nPMID: 39286327\n\nConflict of interest statement: All the authors of above manuscript have \nacclaimed to have no declaration of interest for statement.'},

The two SENV types, SENV-H \nand SENV-D, are non-A to E hepatitis viruses \xa0in those who are infected. The \npurpose of this study is to find out how common SENV and its variations are \namong renal dialysis patients and healthy blood donors.\nMETHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design, with 300 blood samples \ncollected from KFMMC patients, 150 from healthy blood donors and 150 from renal \ndialysis patients, between January 2019 and January 2021. The samples were \nscreened for the presence of SENV-D and\xa0SENV-H.\xa0using nested PCR.\nRESULTS: Molecular analysis of the SEN virus revealed that 9.3% of the samples \n(14 out of 150) tested positive for SEN virus infection in renal dialysis \npatients. The data from healthy donors revealed that 10% of the samples tested \npositive for the SEN virus (15 out of 150).\nCONCLUSIONS: The presence of SEN-V in healthy blood donors and renal dialysis \npatients demonstrates the virus's blood-borne nature and emphasizes the dangers \nof blood-borne transmission.\n\nDOI: 10.23750/abm.v93i5.13005\nPMCID: PMC9686150\nPMID: 36300231 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Each author declares that he or she has no \ncommercial associations (e.g., consultancies, stock ownership, equity interest, \npatent/licensing arrangement etc.) that might pose a conflict of interest in \nconnection with the submitted article."},

The I38 genotype remained dominant in the \nBXA-Sen-infected animals, even with BXA treatment. In competitive-mixture \nexperiments, no transmission to aerosol contacts was seen from BXA-treated \ndonors coinfected with the BXA-Sen and BXA-Res B/Brisbane/60/2008 viruses. \nHowever, in parallel mixed infections with the B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata \nlineage) virus background, BXA treatment failed to block airborne transmission \nof the BXA-Res virus, and the I38T genotype generally predominated. Therefore, \nthe relative fitness of BXA-Res IBVs is complex and dependent on the virus \nbackbone and within-host virus competition. BXA treatment of \nsingle-virus-infected ferrets hampers aerosol transmission of the BXA-Sen virus \nand does not readily generate BXA-Res variants, whereas mixed infections may \nresult in propagation of BXA-Res IBVs of the Yamagata lineage.

In this \nrespect, non pathogenic human commensal viruses, which also demonstrate \nparenteral transmission routes might also be acquired. One of the most widely \nspread parenterally-transmitted human commensal viruses include the Human \nPegivirus-1 (HPgV-1, GBV-C) and Torque teno viruses (TTV) including its SEN \nvirus-like (SENV) forms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the \nprevalence of HPgV-1 RNA and SENV-like viruses, among a group of patients with \nbeta-thalassemia from a Blood Transfusion Center in the São Paulo State, Brazil. \nThe prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA was 14.3 % (n\u202f=\u202f6/42) and all of the positive \nsamples were characterized as belonging to genotype 2 (83.3 % were referred to \nsubgenotype 2A and 16.7 % to 2B). The prevalence of SENV-like viruses was 28.6 % \n(n\u202f=\u202f12/42). SENV-like viruses of the genotypes SENV-H and SENV-A were \nclassified during the performed phylogenetic analysis. Our study came as a \ncontinuation of a viral metagenomic survey among multiple transfused patients \nwith beta-thalassemia. The obtained results shed a light on the prevalence and \ngenotype distribution of commensal parenterally transmitted viruses like HPgV-1 \nand SENV in this specific population.

Temperate phage-antibiotic synergy (tPAS), a unique strategy that \nleverages lysogen-forming phages as adjuvants to traditional antibiotics, has \nbeen validated for phages infecting E. coli and P. aeruginosa and is a major \nstep towards normalization of temperate phages in therapeutics. In this report, \nwe extend tPAS to Burkholderia phages and show that combining these phages with \nsubinhibitory doses of ciprofloxacin overcomes natural limitations in \nantibacterial activity caused by lysogen formation. We further demonstrate that \nthe magnitude of this effect correlates with the lysogenization frequencies of \nutilized phages, meaning tPAS is tailored specifically to otherwise ineffective, \nhighly lysogenic phages. Finally, we observed heterogeneity in lysogen depletion \nrates among synergizing phages, suggesting 'complete' lysogen depletion is not \nrequired for antibacterial synergy.

In rice, it produces \nBacterial Panicle Blight (BPB), an emerging disease that is threatening the \nproduction of this staple food worldwide. Recently, BPB has affected several \nrice fields in Bangladesh, and B. gladioli has been reported as the causative \nagent in one of these fields, raising questions about how the pathogen was \nintroduced into the country. Understanding the introduction routes into \nBangladesh and the pathogenicity mechanisms of B . gladioli is essential to \ndevelop sustainable management strategies to control BPB.\nRESULTS: To investigate the origin of pathogenic B . gladioli strains and their \nintroduction routes into Bangladesh, we sequenced the complete genomes of 19 \nstrains isolated from symptomatic rice panicles from four major rice-growing \ndistricts of the country (Rangpur, Faridpur, Natore, and Mymensingh). A \nphylogenetic analysis encompassing all 320 publicly available B. gladioli \ngenomes along with the 19 newly sequenced genomes revealed five independent \nintroduction events into Bangladesh-four of which showed close phylogenetic \nlinks to clinical isolates from the USA-and no evidence of inter-district \ndissemination within the country. Many host transitions (35 human-to-plant and 1 \nplant-to-human) were inferred across the phylogeny, highlighting the pathogen's \nversatile and cross-kingdom transmission dynamics. Analysis of the \npresence/absence patterns of 37 virulence-related genes across all 339 B. \ngladioli strains indicated that human-to-plant host transitions often coincided \nwith loss of the tsr and motB genes-which are associated with bacterial \nmotility-, suggesting convergent adaptive shifts in response to host switches.\nCONCLUSION: Our findings shed light on the introduction pathways of pathogenic B \n. gladioli strains into Bangladesh and highlight specific virulence-related \ngenes as potentially responsible for cross-kingdom host shifts.\n\nDOI: 10.1101/2025.11.17.688954\nPMCID: PMC12667866\nPMID: 41332683"}],

The patient was a 77 years old man hospitalized for \ntreatment of heart failure and diabetes. On day 83 of hospitalization, he \ndeveloped a fever of 38.0°C, followed three days later by an elevation in \nC-reactive protein. His condition improved with the administration of \ncefmetazole, cefepime, and levofloxacin, and antibiotic therapy was discontinued \non the 17th day after the onset of fever. Blood cultures collected at the onset \nof fever revealed growth in the aerobic bottle after 21\u202fh, and Gram staining \nrevealed slightly slender Gram-negative rods. Based on colony morphology, \nBurkholderia or Ralstonia was initially suspected. However, identification kit \nID Test NF-18 yielded multiple possible organisms, and a definitive \nidentification could not be made. The isolate was ultimately identified as C. \nmetallidurans by phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Because this \nspecies is not included in general bacterial identification kits and cannot be \nreliably distinguished based biochemical characteristics alone, 16S rRNA gene \nsequencing was essential for diagnosis. To date, only five cases of bloodstream \ninfection caused by this species have been reported, in Canada and Italy, and \nthis is the first reported case in Japan.

Although synthetic \nfungicides have long served as the cornerstone of plant disease management, \ngrowing concerns regarding their environmental toxicity, non-target effects, and \nemergence of resistant pathogens have motivated the search for sustainable \nalternatives. Burkholderia spp. have attracted attention as promising biocontrol \nagents (BCAs) due to their production of diverse bioactive secondary metabolites \n(for example, occidiofungin, pyoluteorin, pyrrolnitrin, and cepacin) that \nefficiently suppress fungal pathogens such as Fusarium, Colletotrichum, and \nPythium, and induction of systemic resistance responses in plant hosts. This \nreview summarizes the distribution of Burkholderia in plant-associated niches, \noutlines the procedures for screening potential biocontrol strains, and \nelaborates on the molecular and ecological mechanisms underlying their \nantifungal activity. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation and application \nstrategies that impact biocontrol efficacy, address biosafety and regulatory \nconsiderations, and highlight future research priorities, particularly genome \nmining, functional genetic validation and modification, and regulatory \nframeworks that must be pursued to facilitate the safe and effective \ncommercialization of Burkholderia-based products within integrated pest \nmanagement systems (IPM). The strategic deployment of these strains, supported \nby mechanistic understanding and comprehensive risk assessment, could advance \nsustainable crop protection and contribute to global food security.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

One of the main strategies to improve drought tolerance in plants \nhas been the use of beneficial rhizosphere microorganisms. However, within the \nrhizosphere, microorganisms establish diverse relationships with each other and \nwith the host plants, positively or negatively affecting the drought tolerance. \nTo address this complexity, the use of microorganisms that fulfill different \nniches producing an improved drought stress tolerance may be the basis for the \ndesign of the "Next Generation of Bioinoculants." This study aimed to develop a \nbioinoculant consisting of plant growth-promoting bacteria, yeast, and \narbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for the cultivation of Lactuca sativa. Twenty-seven \nmicrobial consortia were inoculated on lettuce plants and submitted to drought \nstress for 40\u2009days. Four consortia were selected based on their superior biomass \nproduction and tested on agricultural soil subjected to drought. Biomass \nproduction, proline and peroxidative damage, photosynthetic activity, \nantioxidant response, and profiles of phenolic compounds were also evaluated in \nlettuce leaves. Results showed that the consortium composed by Claroideoglomus \nlamellosum, Naganishia albida, and Burkholderia caledonica improved biomass \nproduction of shoots of lettuce plants by 43% under drought stress, primarily by \nenhancing proline, phosphorus, and photosynthetic pigment levels, as well as the \nantioxidant enzyme activities of catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), \nleading to reduced oxidative damage. These findings suggest that \nspecies-specific microbial consortia can serve as effective tools for improving \ndrought tolerance in crops, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices \nin water-limited environments.\n\n© 2025 Scandinavian Plant Physiology Society.\n\nDOI: 10.1111/ppl.70660\nPMID: 41320810 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'}],

In recent years, the \nrole of microorganisms in its pathogenesis has attracted considerable attention. \nAlthough studies have suggested that certain microbes present in the gut and \nurine are associated with the formation of urinary stones, the current criteria \nfor stone classification are not rigorous enough. Therefore, this study aimed to \nanalyze the gut and urinary microbiota composition via 16S rRNA sequencing in \npatients with pure CaOx, pure UA, and pure Inf stones. By integrating these \nmicrobiota data with clinical data, we constructed machine learning models and \nevaluated their diagnostic value in distinguishing stone types.\nMETHODS: A total of 81 patients with urinary stones (including 30 with pure CaOx \nstones, 31 with pure UA stones, and 20 with pure Inf stones) and 26 healthy \nvolunteers were enrolled. Stool and urine samples were collected from each \nparticipant and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing to obtain microbiota data and \ncharacterize the gut and urinary microbiota profiles of patients with different \nstone types. We further integrated microbiota and clinical data, such as age, \ngender and BMI, using LASSO feature selection and six machine learning \nalgorithms (e.g. SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost) to create prediction models for \nstone type. Model performance was evaluated through cross-validation.\nRESULTS: Results showed enrichment of Paramuribaculum, Muribaculum, \nMesorhizobium, and Acinetobacter in the gut of CaOx stone patients, with \nconcurrent urinary enrichment of Enterococcus. Patients with UA stones \ndemonstrated an increase in the abundance of Massilioclostridium in the gut and \nan increase in the abundance of Fenollaria, Anaerococcus, Enterococcus and \nEscherichia in the urine. Patients with Inf stones showed no differentially \nabundant gut taxa compared to healthy volunteers, but did exhibit urinary \nenrichment of Escherichia. The predictive model, which was based on urinary \nmicrobiota and clinical data, demonstrated excellent performance. The AUC was \n0.922, 0.866 and 0.913 for the SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost models, \nrespectively.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals that different types of stone are characterized \nby distinct compositions of microbiota. Machine learning models based on \nmicrobiota and clinical data can predict urinary stone types noninvasively. This \nprovides novel insights into the microecological mechanisms of urinary stones \nand opens up new avenues for clinical diagnosis.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Liu, Yang, Zhang, Shen, Wang and Li.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2025.1623429\nPMCID: PMC12589065\nPMID: 41210937 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

This study \ndemonstrated that the Loop2-3 domains of MhOpa22 interact with AsGLP1 in planta. \nInoculating A. sinicus with different M. huakuii loop deletion mutants revealed \nthat the Loop2 mutant gives rise to fewer root nodules and decreased nodule \nnitrogenase activity relative to inoculation with the wild-type strain. The \nLoop2 mutation also significantly affects reactive oxygen species production and \nthe coordinated expression of defense and symbiosis genes in host plant roots \nduring early symbiosis. Furthermore, MhOpa22 was confirmed to be a membrane \nprotein that exerts its function via outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Taken \ntogether, these results provide molecular insights into the function of the \nouter membrane protein MhOpa22 and its critical extracellular Loop2 domain \nduring symbiosis.

This \nstudy aimed to characterize the reproductive tract microbiome in both subtypes \nto support the development of methods for the non-invasive categorization of \nEPs. Using metagenomic sequencing, we analyzed vaginal and cervical samples from \n27 reproductive-aged patients with single EP and 22 with multiple EP. Compared \nwith controls and multiple EP cases, single EP vaginal and cervical samples \nexhibited a lower percentage of community state types (CST) I and II. Sneathia \namnii was identified as a characteristic species in both the vagina (P = 0.0051) \nand cervix (P = 0.0398) of single EP patients compared with controls. \nMesorhizobium sp. (vaginal P = 0.0110, cervical P = 0.0210), Acinetobacter \nbaumannii (vaginal P = 8.0 × 10-5, cervical P = 0.0314), and Pasteurella \nmultocida (vaginal P = 0.0173, cervical P = 0.0210) were enriched in single EP \ncompared with multiple EP. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) \nenrichment analysis of vaginal microbiome revealed unique pathways in single EP, \nincluding aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, pantothenate and coenzyme A (CoA) \nsynthesis, pyrimidine metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and biosynthesis \nof phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Using a random forest model, we \nfurther selected microbiota and clinical parameters to differentiate single and \nmultiple EPs, thus achieving an area under curve (AUC) of 0.861. Our findings \ncharacterized the composition of the cervicovaginal microbiota of single and \nmultiple EPs and proposed biomarkers for their non-invasive classification based \non a random forest model.IMPORTANCEThe prevalence rate of endometrial polyps \n(EPs), a common gynecological condition, varies between 7.8% and 34.9%. Multiple \nEPs are associated with higher recurrence rates and chronic endometritis than \nsingle EPs and thus require more aggressive clinical interventions. However, \nonly laparoscopic surgery can accurately identify single and multiple polyps. \nNon-invasive adjunctive diagnostic methods can aid in altering surgical \nindications preoperatively. Using metagenomic sequencing, we thoroughly analyzed \nthe vaginal and cervical samples of 27 single EP and 22 multiple EP patients of \nreproductive age. We then identified distinct microbial patterns in the single \nand multiple samples, which were crucial for understanding EP pathogenesis and \nits association with gynecological health. Using a random forest model, key \nbacterial taxa that differentiate single and multiple EPs were identified with \nhigh accuracy. These could potentially serve as non-invasive diagnostic \nbiomarkers. This research delineates the cervicovaginal microbiome of the \nreproductive tract in EP patients, offering a basis for developing non-invasive \ndiagnostic tools and personalized treatment strategies.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/msystems.00023-25\nPMCID: PMC12542703\nPMID: 40952003 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'},

In \nMediterranean regions, and particularly in Tunisia, fungal attacks are likely to \nfurther aggravate drought stress and increase the economic vulnerability of \nchickpea production. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and rhizobia \nhave the potential to enhance plant growth and mitigate the adverse effects of \nbiotic and abiotic stresses. The objective of this study was to isolate \nnon-rhizobial rhizosphere bacteria from the soil and evaluate their ability to \nenhance plants' growth and symbiotic performance and to control chickpea wilt \ncaused by F. redolens. A total of 26 bacterial isolates from rhizosphere soil \nsamples were subsequently evaluated for their antagonistic properties against \nfive phytopathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporum solani, Fusarium oxysporum \nmatthioli, Fusarium oxysporum MN-2, Fusarium oxysporum 184, and Fusarium \nrdolens). Seven bacterial isolates demonstrated in vitro plant-beneficial \ncharacteristics and/or antagonistic activity against 5 Fusarium strains. Two \nbacterial strains including Streptomyces diastaticus subsp. diastaticus and \nBacillus subtilis were chosen for additional investigation because they showed \nthe greatest number of plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits and exhibited an \nantagonistic effect on pathogens. Assays conducted in pots showed that PGPRs \nco-inoculated with Mesorhizobium sp. Bj1 protected chickpea plants from F. \nredolens infection and enhanced plant growth and nutrient uptake. Pot \nexperiments carried out in a greenhouse further demonstrated that the \nco-inoculation of chickpea plants with the bacterial strains and a Mesorhizobium \nstrain lessened the severity of the F. redolens infection. These results suggest \nthat co-inoculation with S. diastaticus subsp. diastaticus and Mesorhizobium sp. \nBj1 may act as a helpful bioformulation to boost chickpea plants' growth and \nprotect them from wilting. Other PGPR candidates included Mesorhizobium spp. and \nB. subtilis strains. Both Mesorhizobium sp. Bj1 and the uninoculated plants were \nused as controls. The association of PGPR with other inoculants potentially \ncould substitute for chemical fertilizers, and testing of PGPR under field \nconditions will further elucidate their effectiveness on grain yields of \nchickpea.\n\n© 2025 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.\n\nDOI: 10.3934/microbiol.2025015\nPMCID: PMC12207264\nPMID: 40600212\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of interest: The authors declare no \nconflict of interest."},

Seasonal grazing management can benefit grassland \nproductivity and soil nutrient cycling in alpine meadows, but its effects on \nsoil P availability and the microbial processes driving P transformation remain \npoorly understood. To address this, a long-term field experiment was conducted \nwith five different spring rest-grazing periods, where soil P fractions were \nexamined and metagenomic sequencing was employed to assess the functional \nprofiles of microbial genes involved in P cycling. Early spring rest-grazing led \nto higher concentrations of labile P fractions (Resin-P and NaHCO3-Pi), \nindicating improved soil P availability. Moreover, rest-grazing in early spring \nsignificantly reduced HCl-Pi concentration while increased the concentration of \nconc. HCl-Po.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, \nparticularly regarding how distinct AMF species regulate the rhizosphere \nmicrobiome.\nRESULTS: Five AMF species (Funneliformis mosseae, Diversispora versiformis, \nClariodeoglous etunicatum, Rhizophagus intraradices, and Acaulospora delicate) \nwere inoculated to investigate their effects on tobacco seedling growth and \nrhizosphere microecological regulation. The results showed that all AMF \ninoculations significantly increased shoot and root biomass, N/P/K uptake, \nmorphological traits (height, stem diameter, leaf area), chlorophyll content \n(SPAD), and root architecture (length, surface area, volume, diameter) of \ntobacco seedlings. Among them, the treatment inoculated with R. intraradices \nshowed the most outstanding growth-promoting effect in all growth indicators. \nMetagenomic analysis indicated that AMF inoculation significantly altered the \ndiversity and community structure of rhizosphere substrate microorganisms. Among \nthem, R. intraradices inoculation yielded the highest microbial diversity, with \nan associated network exhibiting enhanced complexity. KEGG functional annotation \nrevealed metabolic pathways (IAA biosynthesis, iron-siderophore transport \nregulation, exopolysaccharide production, and nutrient cycling) consistently \nassociated with tobacco growth promotion in all AMF inoculations. However, \nspecies-specific mechanisms were observed: F. mosseae promotes tobacco seedling \ngrowth by enhancing IAA synthesis through the recruitment of beneficial \nmicroorganisms such as Nostoc, Flavisolibacter, Frateuria, and Sphingomonas. D. \nversiformis enhanced carbon fixation via the hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate \ncycle, driven by the proliferation of Glaciecola, Pedococcus, Phycicoccus, and \nHephaestia. C. etunicatum facilitated phosphorus/iron accumulation through \norganic phosphorus mineralization, phosphate transport, and iron acquisition \naccompanied by the recruitment of, Hartmannibacter, Lysobacter, Moheibacter, and \nPseudolabrys. R. intraradices improved nitrogen assimilation through augmented \nnitrogen transport and assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA), correlated with \nthe recruitment of Azospirillum, Sphingobium, Mesorhizobium, Paracoccus, and \nParafilimonas. A. delicate stimulated plant growth via polyphosphate degradation \nand exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, associated with the enrichment of \nSegetibacter, Ferruginibacter, Hyphomicrobium and Pseudomonas. Notably, this \nstudy revealed that functional divergence in rhizosphere microbiomes associated \nwith the five tested fungal species was primarily reflected in the abundance \nrather than the composition of functional genes.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, AMF inoculation significantly enhanced tobacco seedling \nbiomass and agronomic traits by improving mineral nutrient assimilation \nefficiency and restructuring the rhizosphere microbial community. Different AMF \nspecies exhibited distinct microecological regulation patterns.

In recent years, the \nrole of microorganisms in its pathogenesis has attracted considerable attention. \nAlthough studies have suggested that certain microbes present in the gut and \nurine are associated with the formation of urinary stones, the current criteria \nfor stone classification are not rigorous enough. Therefore, this study aimed to \nanalyze the gut and urinary microbiota composition via 16S rRNA sequencing in \npatients with pure CaOx, pure UA, and pure Inf stones. By integrating these \nmicrobiota data with clinical data, we constructed machine learning models and \nevaluated their diagnostic value in distinguishing stone types.\nMETHODS: A total of 81 patients with urinary stones (including 30 with pure CaOx \nstones, 31 with pure UA stones, and 20 with pure Inf stones) and 26 healthy \nvolunteers were enrolled. Stool and urine samples were collected from each \nparticipant and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing to obtain microbiota data and \ncharacterize the gut and urinary microbiota profiles of patients with different \nstone types. We further integrated microbiota and clinical data, such as age, \ngender and BMI, using LASSO feature selection and six machine learning \nalgorithms (e.g. SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost) to create prediction models for \nstone type. Model performance was evaluated through cross-validation.\nRESULTS: Results showed enrichment of Paramuribaculum, Muribaculum, \nMesorhizobium, and Acinetobacter in the gut of CaOx stone patients, with \nconcurrent urinary enrichment of Enterococcus. Patients with UA stones \ndemonstrated an increase in the abundance of Massilioclostridium in the gut and \nan increase in the abundance of Fenollaria, Anaerococcus, Enterococcus and \nEscherichia in the urine. Patients with Inf stones showed no differentially \nabundant gut taxa compared to healthy volunteers, but did exhibit urinary \nenrichment of Escherichia. The predictive model, which was based on urinary \nmicrobiota and clinical data, demonstrated excellent performance. The AUC was \n0.922, 0.866 and 0.913 for the SVM, Random Forest and XGBoost models, \nrespectively.\nCONCLUSION: This study reveals that different types of stone are characterized \nby distinct compositions of microbiota. Machine learning models based on \nmicrobiota and clinical data can predict urinary stone types noninvasively. This \nprovides novel insights into the microecological mechanisms of urinary stones \nand opens up new avenues for clinical diagnosis.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Liu, Yang, Zhang, Shen, Wang and Li.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2025.1623429\nPMCID: PMC12589065\nPMID: 41210937 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

Recently, resident microbiomes in several organs including the \nlung have been demonstrated to control host immunity but their role in the \nresponse to cancer immunotherapy is still unknown.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study analyzed 32 high \nPD-L1-TPS lung cancer patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). \nWe carried out shotgun metagenome sequencing using frozen tumor tissues, then \nanalyzed the correlation between the intratumoral microbiota and response to ICI \ntherapy.\nRESULTS: In this study, only 56.3% of patients with high PD-L1-TPS showed \nresponse to ICI therapy. Among 11 significant compositional differences in \nintratumoral microbiota observed in ICI responders, there was significantly \nlonger progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with abundant Tetrasphaera \nand Mesorhizobium. Of patients with these abundant microbiota, 83.3% showed \nresponse to ICI therapy and all patients without these microbiota were ICI \nnonresponders (P = 0.0050). There were significant differences among three \ngroups classified by the abundance of g_Tetrasphaera and g_Mesorhizobium (PFS, P \n= 0.0016 and overall survival, P = 0.0013).

However, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, \nparticularly regarding how distinct AMF species regulate the rhizosphere \nmicrobiome.\nRESULTS: Five AMF species (Funneliformis mosseae, Diversispora versiformis, \nClariodeoglous etunicatum, Rhizophagus intraradices, and Acaulospora delicate) \nwere inoculated to investigate their effects on tobacco seedling growth and \nrhizosphere microecological regulation. The results showed that all AMF \ninoculations significantly increased shoot and root biomass, N/P/K uptake, \nmorphological traits (height, stem diameter, leaf area), chlorophyll content \n(SPAD), and root architecture (length, surface area, volume, diameter) of \ntobacco seedlings. Among them, the treatment inoculated with R. intraradices \nshowed the most outstanding growth-promoting effect in all growth indicators. \nMetagenomic analysis indicated that AMF inoculation significantly altered the \ndiversity and community structure of rhizosphere substrate microorganisms. Among \nthem, R. intraradices inoculation yielded the highest microbial diversity, with \nan associated network exhibiting enhanced complexity. KEGG functional annotation \nrevealed metabolic pathways (IAA biosynthesis, iron-siderophore transport \nregulation, exopolysaccharide production, and nutrient cycling) consistently \nassociated with tobacco growth promotion in all AMF inoculations. However, \nspecies-specific mechanisms were observed: F. mosseae promotes tobacco seedling \ngrowth by enhancing IAA synthesis through the recruitment of beneficial \nmicroorganisms such as Nostoc, Flavisolibacter, Frateuria, and Sphingomonas. D. \nversiformis enhanced carbon fixation via the hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate \ncycle, driven by the proliferation of Glaciecola, Pedococcus, Phycicoccus, and \nHephaestia. C. etunicatum facilitated phosphorus/iron accumulation through \norganic phosphorus mineralization, phosphate transport, and iron acquisition \naccompanied by the recruitment of, Hartmannibacter, Lysobacter, Moheibacter, and \nPseudolabrys. R. intraradices improved nitrogen assimilation through augmented \nnitrogen transport and assimilatory nitrate reduction (ANRA), correlated with \nthe recruitment of Azospirillum, Sphingobium, Mesorhizobium, Paracoccus, and \nParafilimonas. A. delicate stimulated plant growth via polyphosphate degradation \nand exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, associated with the enrichment of \nSegetibacter, Ferruginibacter, Hyphomicrobium and Pseudomonas. Notably, this \nstudy revealed that functional divergence in rhizosphere microbiomes associated \nwith the five tested fungal species was primarily reflected in the abundance \nrather than the composition of functional genes.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, AMF inoculation significantly enhanced tobacco seedling \nbiomass and agronomic traits by improving mineral nutrient assimilation \nefficiency and restructuring the rhizosphere microbial community. Different AMF \nspecies exhibited distinct microecological regulation patterns. This study \nelucidated the growth-promoting mechanisms of AMF from a microbial interaction \nperspective, providing a theoretical basis for establishing a sustainable \ntobacco cultivation system.\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material \navailable at 10.1186/s12870-025-07600-9.\n\nDOI: 10.1186/s12870-025-07600-9\nPMCID: PMC12619451\nPMID: 41239203\n\nConflict of interest statement: Declarations.

Astragalus sinicus, a widely used leguminous green manure in East \nAsian paddy fields, harbors distinct microbial assemblages across plant \ncompartments, yet the ecological processes driving microbiome assembly along its \nphyllosphere-rhizosphere continuum remain unclear. In this study, we profiled \nmicrobiome composition across the rhizospheric, phyllospheric, and soil \ncompartments of A. sinicus using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing targeting the \nregion south of the Yangtze River, analyzing 315 samples collected from seven \nrice-growing regions. We found that Proteobacteria predominated all sampled \ncompartments, with Mesorhizobium (75.85-96.93%) constituting the predominant \ntaxon in the root microbiome. The leaf microbiome showed higher variability, \ndominated by Vibrionimonas (0.31-46.6%), Pantoea (0.71-46.61%), Pseudomonas \n(0.07-24.6%) and Bradyrhizobium (0.06-8.45%). Co-occurrence networks revealed a \ndistinct gradient, including expansive yet weakly connected soil networks, \nmoderately sized and highly modular leaf networks, and compact, highly robust \nroot consortia, delineating a shift from environmentally driven complexity to \nhost-filtered stability. Root and leaf microbiome assembly was primarily \ngoverned by stochastic processes (-\u20092\u2009<\u2009β-NTI\u2009<\u20092, NCM r2\u2009>\u200970%) and plant- \nmediated selection (DI\u2009=\u20090.01/0.02, DSI\u2009=\u20090.09/0.14), with soil nutrient \nconditions, particularly total nitrogen, organic carbon, available phosphorus, \nand available potassiu, playing significant roles in shaping microbiome \ncomposition (p\u2009<\u20090.05). These core plant-associated ASVs were selectively \nenriched by the plant from the soil in over 70% of the sampled regions. Among \nthese, Mesorhizobium in roots and Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum in leaves were \nfound to be critical for nitrogen fixation and nutrient cycling, as evidenced by \nprevious studies. Our results highlight the intricate interactions between \nplants, microbes, and their environment, underscoring the importance of \nplant-mediated selection and soil nutrient conditions in shaping the microbiome \nof A. sinicus, with significant implications for sustainable agricultural \npractices.\n\n© 2025.

Argyrins are formed \nby a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), originating from the myxobacterial \nproducer strains Archangium gephyra Ar8082 and Cystobacter sp. SBCb004. In this \nwork, a previously established heterologous production platform was employed to \nprovide evidence of direct D-configured amino acid incorporation by the argyrin \nassembly line. An adenylation domain of the argyrin NRPS was characterized and \nshown to have a high preference for D-configured amino acids. Eight novel \nargyrin derivatives were generated via biosynthetic engineering of the \nheterologous production system. The system was also optimized to enable \nformation of methylated argyrin C and D derivatives with improved \nimmunosuppressive activity compared with their unmethylated counterparts. \nFurthermore, the optimization of cultivation conditions allowed exclusive \nproduction of one major derivative at a time, drastically improving the \npurification process. Importantly, engineering of transcription and translation \ninitiation resulted in a substantially improved production titre reaching \n350-400\u2009mg\u2009l-1 .

In this study, the \ndegradation of high concentrations of antibiotic sulfadiazine (SDZ) by advanced \noxidation processes that leverage different reactive oxide species was \nsystematically evaluated in terms of the influence of different degradation \nintermediates on the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs).

The study was \ncarried out under various four treatments, urea (0.8033\xa0g), blank chitosan \nmicrospheres (without urea), Cm-CRNFs (0.8033\xa0g), and a control group (CK). The \nresults indicated that Cm-CRNFs significantly prolonged the nitrogen release and \nenhanced the plant shoot length, shoot diameter, number of branches, pods, total \namino acids, and vitamin C of Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis as well as increased \nthe soil nutrient availability.

Furthermore, Cm-CRNFs \ntreatment significantly influenced genus richness level of Arthrobacter, \nArchangium, Bacillus, and Flavihumibacter. Moreover, relative abundance of \nbacteria significantly enhanced Cm-CRNFs, including Acidobacteriota, \nAcitinobacteriota, Cloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, and Patescibacteria. Soil enzyme \nactivity such as: urease, acid phosphatase, and catalase enzymes in Cm-CRNFs and \nurea treatment significantly increased. Besides, other enzymes such as: \ncellulase and β-glucosidase activity decreased in the Cm-CRNFs treatment.

In order to solve these \nproblems, 133 soil samples were collected from the east to the west of Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region and divided into five groups. The water content, pH, \norganic matter, available phosphorus, hydrolytic nitrogen, and available \npotassium content of soil samples were determined by national standards and \nother methods. The quantitative assessment of the abundance of myxobacteria in \nthe soil sample was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. The composition of \nmyxobacteria in the soil was determined by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing \ntechnology to analyze the differences in the community structure of myxobacteria \namong different groups, explore the relationship between the diversity of \nmyxobacteria resources and the distribution and physical and chemical properties \nof the soil, and predict and analyze its community function. The results showed \nthat there were abundant myxobacteria resources in the soils of Inner Mongolia, \nand the average relative abundance of myxobacteria in the soil samples from the \ncentral part of Inner Mongolia was higher than that in the eastern and western \nparts, but the richness and diversity of samples from the central to eastern \nregions were significantly higher than those from the western regions. The \nmyxobacteria resources in the whole region included 10 families and 22 genera, \namong which the dominant genera were Labilitrix, Sandaracinus, Archangium, and \nHaliangium. The analysis of the species composition of myxobacteria among \ndifferent groups found that the distribution of soil and soil type had an impact \non the species composition of the samples. The species with significant \ndifferences in relative abundance among the five groups of samples were \nLabilitrix, Archangium, Sandaracinus, Minicystis, Polyangium, and Myxococcus. In \naddition, the latitude and longitude of the sampling point and the soil pH, \nwater content, available phosphorus content and organic matter content had a \ngreater impact on the myxobacteria community structure of samples, while the \naltitude of the soil sample and the contents of available potassium and alkaline \nnitrogen had a relatively small impact. Our data suggest that the distribution, \ntype and nutrient composition of soil samples have an impact on the relative \nabundance and species composition of myxobacteria community.

Data from Eastern Europe and \nthe Caucasus are scarce, limiting region-specific infection control strategies.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective multicenter surveillance study across five \ntertiary hospitals in Georgia from May 2020 to December 2023. A total of 484 \nrespiratory specimens were obtained from 397 adult patients with \nmicrobiologically confirmed NP. Pathogen identification was performed using \nculture and MALDI-TOF MS, with antimicrobial susceptibility testing according to \nCLSI guidelines. PCR assays detected major resistance genes. Epidemiological, \nmolecular, and clinical outcomes were evaluated, including temporal trends and \ncomparisons between ICU and non-ICU patients.\nRESULTS: Gram-negative bacteria predominated (71.7%), with Pseudomonas \naeruginosa (41.9%) as the leading pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus aureus \n(21.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (13.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), and \nStreptococcus pneumoniae (9.3%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was identified in \n80% of isolates, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) phenotypes in 18.4%, and \npandrug-resistant (PDR) phenotypes in 1.4%. ESBL prevalence increased from 48.3% \nin 2020 to 79.8% in 2023 (p\u2009<\u20090.001), carbapenemase expression doubled from \n15.0% to 30.2% (p\u2009<\u20090.01), and colistin resistance rose from 2.5% to 8.5% \n(p\u2009<\u20090.05). ICU isolates showed significantly higher MDR and XDR rates than \nthose from non-ICU settings (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Thirty-day mortality correlated with \nresistance phenotype, ranging from 18.2% in susceptible infections to 71.4% in \nPDR cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: This four-year study shows high and increasing antimicrobial \nresistance among NP pathogens in Georgia, especially in ICU settings. The rise \nin ESBL, carbapenemase, and colistin resistance highlights the need to \nstrengthen antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention, and genomic \nsurveillance to control the spread of high-risk strains and improve patient \noutcomes in resource-limited settings.\n\n© 2025.

K. pneumoniae has two \npathotypes: classical (cKp) and hypervirulent (hvKp). CKp typically causes \nopportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals in healthcare settings \nand often is multi-drug resistant. HvKp can be community-acquired and cause \nhigh-mortality infections in immunocompetent individuals. Concerningly, \nantibiotic-resistant cKp strains with hypervirulence-associated genes and traits \nhave recently emerged. Determining if and how hv-associated genes contribute to \nincreased virulence of cKp strains is essential to addressing this growing \nthreat. The rmpADC operon is an hv-associated locus that confers \nhypermucoviscosity (HMV), a key virulence phenotype, and rmp genes are often \nfound in convergent strains. In this study, we aimed to determine if the rmp \ngenes alone could increase the virulence of cKp strains in the absence of other \nhv-associated genes. We introduced genetically distinct rmp loci from different \nlineages into a broad array of cKp isolates and found that, while many isolates \nbecame HMV positive, only a subset of these strains showed an increase in \nvirulence in a mouse model of pneumonia. Sequence type and capsule type were not \npredictive of how rmp acquisition impacted the clinical isolates. Our results \nindicate that HMV is likely necessary but not sufficient for hypervirulence and \nthat rmp sequence can influence virulence potential in cKp \nstrains.IMPORTANCEKlebsiella pneumoniae is a global pathogen, and gene exchange \nbetween hypervirulent (hvKp) and classical (cKp) strains is a rising threat. It \nis essential to understand how hvKp genes impact virulence phenotypes and \nidentify the cKp strain backgrounds most amenable to enhanced virulence. \nHypermucoviscosity (HMV) is a critical virulence factor in hypervirulent K. \npneumoniae, conferred by the rmpADC locus. The rmp genes are encoded on mobile \ngenetic elements and have been detected in convergent antibiotic-resistant K. \npneumoniae strains of concern. In this study, we explored the impact of rmp \nacquisition in a broad set of classical clinical isolates. We observed that HMV \nappears necessary, but not sufficient, for increased virulence. Sequence type, \ncapsule type, and HMV capacity could not predict which classical isolates gain \nan rmp-dependent colonization benefit. These insights increase our understanding \nof the distinctions between cKp and hvKp and further our ability to identify and \ntreat new strains of concern.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.03122-25\nPMID: 41363447'},

Among 2312 isolates, \nGram-negative bacteria (52.4%) predominated over Gram-positive bacteria (45.5%), \nwith fungi comprising 2.1%. The prevalence of Gram-negative bacteria showed an \nincreasing trend, while that of Gram-positive bacteria declined.

Notably, 37 cases of polymicrobial BSIs were identified. S. aureus, \nE. coli, and K. pneumoniae exhibited high resistance to most common antibiotics. \nAlthough resistance rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and \ncarbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae have decreased, they remain substantial. \nConversely, carbapenem-resistant E. coli prevalence increased annually. The \nmicrobes causing BSI are diverse, with varying epidemic characteristics and \nantibiotic resistance trends. Continuous monitoring of BSI pathogen epidemiology \nand resistance trends is essential to guide empirical therapy and control \nresistant strain transmission.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Weiliang Cao et al.

Rapid and accurate \ndetection of carbapenemase activity is crucial for guiding appropriate \nantimicrobial therapy and controlling nosocomial transmission. Matrix-assisted \nlaser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) \nenables direct detection of carbapenem hydrolysis but is currently limited by \nthe drawbacks of conventional organic matrices, such as high background \ninterference, toxic solvents, and poor reproducibility. In this study, we report \na novel nanocomposite matrix, GNP@Zn-Cu/MOF@Au, synthesized via a green, \naqueous-phase method without toxic reagents or extreme conditions. This \nheterostructured material exhibited a large mesoporous surface area, excellent \nUV absorption, and thermal responsiveness, which enhanced signal intensity, \nreproducibility, and analytical sensitivity, significantly improving MALDI-TOF \nMS performance. When applied to the identification of carbapenemase activity in \nclinical CPKP isolates, the matrix achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity \nafter 1 hour of incubation and 97.3% sensitivity after just 15 minutes. Notably, \nKPC-2-producing strains were detected with full sensitivity within 15 minutes, \nwhile extended incubation enabled reliable identification of low-activity \nenzymes such as OXA-48. These findings demonstrate the strong potential of \nGNP@Zn-Cu/MOF@Au as a reliable and sustainable alternative to conventional \nmatrices for rapid and accurate detection of carbapenemase activity in clinical \ndiagnostics.\n\nDOI: 10.1039/d5an00967g\nPMID: 41358958'},

Infrared (IR) spectra were acquired \nfrom dried spots of bacterial suspensions in ethanol solution, with three \nindependent cultures of each isolate. FTIR spectroscopy exploratory data \nanalysis, performed by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Principal \nComponent Analysis (PCA), revealed six distinct clusters. These showed perfect \nconcordance with K locus typing (Adjusted Rand index [AR]: 100\xa0%), very high \nconcordance with sequence type (ST) (AR: 99.1\xa0%), and high but lower concordance \nwith the O locus (AR: 90.6\xa0%). All MDR outbreak isolates clustered tightly \ntogether, indicating strong spectral similarity and confirming their clonal \nrelatedness.

Due to the ability of \nthis bacterium to evade antibiotics, phage therapy is becoming a promising tool. \nHowever, the use of isolated proteins rather than entire phages could reduce \nseveral risks associated with phage replication. Thus, understanding the protein \ncomposition and structural organization of bacteriophages is crucial for \nunlocking their biology and holds great potential for medicine and \nbiotechnology.\nMETHODS: In this study, artificial intelligence with AlphaFold 3.0 (AF3) and \nbioinformatic analysis were used to model the hitherto unknown structure of the \nKlebsiella phage KP32 (KP32), a complex and selective phage that targets K. \npneumoniae strains with the K3 and K21/KL163 capsular serotypes.\nRESULTS: By combining AF3 with sequence and structure analysis, we reconstructed \nthe entire phage KP32. This complex phage is composed of over 500 protein \nchains, of which 415 compose its capsid and 104 its core-portal-tail complex, a \nplatform that allows the phage to adhere to K. pneumoniae, hydrolyze its \ncapsular sugars and finally inject its genetic code into the bacterium.\nCONCLUSIONS: Phage therapy is a potentially promising tool for controlling \nantimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, one limitation arises from the limited \nknowledge of their nature and mechanisms of action, as only a few phages have \nbeen structurally characterized. The reconstruction of entire phages is \ncurrently a viable strategy for elucidating their mechanistic properties, \nknowledge that will enhance their potential applications as therapeutic \nalternatives.\n\n© 2025 The Author(s).

K. pneumoniae has two \npathotypes: classical (cKp) and hypervirulent (hvKp). CKp typically causes \nopportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals in healthcare settings \nand often is multi-drug resistant. HvKp can be community-acquired and cause \nhigh-mortality infections in immunocompetent individuals. Concerningly, \nantibiotic-resistant cKp strains with hypervirulence-associated genes and traits \nhave recently emerged. Determining if and how hv-associated genes contribute to \nincreased virulence of cKp strains is essential to addressing this growing \nthreat. The rmpADC operon is an hv-associated locus that confers \nhypermucoviscosity (HMV), a key virulence phenotype, and rmp genes are often \nfound in convergent strains. In this study, we aimed to determine if the rmp \ngenes alone could increase the virulence of cKp strains in the absence of other \nhv-associated genes. We introduced genetically distinct rmp loci from different \nlineages into a broad array of cKp isolates and found that, while many isolates \nbecame HMV positive, only a subset of these strains showed an increase in \nvirulence in a mouse model of pneumonia. Sequence type and capsule type were not \npredictive of how rmp acquisition impacted the clinical isolates. Our results \nindicate that HMV is likely necessary but not sufficient for hypervirulence and \nthat rmp sequence can influence virulence potential in cKp \nstrains.IMPORTANCEKlebsiella pneumoniae is a global pathogen, and gene exchange \nbetween hypervirulent (hvKp) and classical (cKp) strains is a rising threat. It \nis essential to understand how hvKp genes impact virulence phenotypes and \nidentify the cKp strain backgrounds most amenable to enhanced virulence. \nHypermucoviscosity (HMV) is a critical virulence factor in hypervirulent K. \npneumoniae, conferred by the rmpADC locus. The rmp genes are encoded on mobile \ngenetic elements and have been detected in convergent antibiotic-resistant K. \npneumoniae strains of concern. In this study, we explored the impact of rmp \nacquisition in a broad set of classical clinical isolates. We observed that HMV \nappears necessary, but not sufficient, for increased virulence. Sequence type, \ncapsule type, and HMV capacity could not predict which classical isolates gain \nan rmp-dependent colonization benefit. These insights increase our understanding \nof the distinctions between cKp and hvKp and further our ability to identify and \ntreat new strains of concern.\n\nDOI: 10.1128/mbio.03122-25\nPMID: 41363447'},

The aim of our study is to identify the carbapenem resistance genes \nof K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples \nsent from the intensive care units of our hospital and to investigate the clonal \nrelationship among them.\nMETHODOLOGY: K. pneumoniae strains isolated from blood and CSF samples routinely \ncollected from the intensive care units of our hospital over a two-year period \nwere included in the study. Carbapenemase screening of CRKP strains was \nperformed using Carba NP and CIM tests. Additionally, carbapenemase resistance \ngenes (blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, and blaOXA-48) and clone analysis were \nperformed using AP-PCR on these strains.\nRESULTS: A total of 186 strains with reduced susceptibility to at least one \ncarbapenem were detected. In carbapenemase screening, the sensitivity of the CIM \ntest was 98.3% (169/172), specificity was 7.1% (1/14); the sensitivity of Carba \nNP was 90.7% (156/172), specificity was 78.6% (11/14). 83.9% of the strains were \nblaOXA-48, 4.8% blaNDM, and 3.8% blaKPC positive. blaIMP and blaVIM resistance \ngenes were not detected. One hundred and eighty-six K. pneumoniae isolates were \nidentified with 62 different genotypes, and isolates showing clustering were \ngrouped into 30 different clusters. The clustering rate of these isolates was \n82.8%.\nCONCLUSIONS: Resistant bacteria can cause small outbreaks in ICUs.

The \nrecent genetic evolution of K. pneumoniae has led to the emergence of strains \nexhibiting both hypervirulence and multidrug resistance (MDR). In this study, we \ncompared the genomic characteristics of MDR in classical and hypervirulent K. \npneumoniae clinical isolates. Sixty-four isolates were collected from two \nhealthcare institutions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, and identified using \nstandard microbiological techniques. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed \non 30 selected isolates using an Illumina platform. The sequencing data were \nanalysed with the Kleborate tool. WGS analysis identified sequence types ST147 \n(n\u2009=\u20097, 23%) and ST2629 (n\u2009=\u20095, 16.6%) as the most prevalent lineages. \nAdditionally, 13 other ST were detected, including ST147-1LV (n\u2009=\u20091, 3.3%) and \nST859 (n\u2009=\u20091, 3.3%), which exhibited hypervirulent MDR traits. Among \nK-loci-associated virulence determinants, KL64 was the most predominant (n\u2009=\u20097, \n23%), while the O-serotype O1/O2v1 was found in 22 isolates. A diverse range of \nantimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants was observed across isolates. \nPlasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes (qnrS1, qnrB1, qnrB4, qepA2) \nand aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib-cr, strA, strB) \nwere detected in both classical and hypervirulent strains. β-lactamase genes \nincluded bla-SHV variants (bla-SHV-1, bla-SHV-11, bla-SHV-25, bla-SHV-187), \nbla-CTX-M-15, bla-VEB-5, bla-OXA-1, bla-OXA-48, and bla-OXA-181. Additional \nresistance genes conferred resistance to macrolides (ermB, mphB), phenicols \n(catB4, catA1, floR), sulfonamides (sul1, sul2), tetracyclines (tetA, tetB, \ntetD), and trimethoprim (dfrA1, dfrA12, dfrA14). Acquired AmpC and other \nβ-lactamases (DHA-1, TEM-1D, CMH-1, CMY-6, LAP-2, AmpC1) were also present. The \nmost prevalent plasmid replicons were Col(pHAD28), IncFIB(K), and IncR, with the \nhypervirulent ST147-1LV isolate carrying the highest number.

A main component of TEO, carvacrol, is known for its \nantimicrobial and insecticidal activity. Carvacrol has potent antibacterial, \nantioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifungal properties, generating interest \nin traditional medicine. However, studies on its antiviral activity are limited. \nGiven the rise in viral infections and limitations of synthetic antiviral drugs, \nnatural antiviral agents are promising due to their efficacy, lower resistance \ndevelopment, and reduced side effects. This study assessed the antiviral \nefficacy of TEO compared to that of pure carvacrol. We tested various viruses, \nrevealing significant inhibitory effects of TEO on the replication of only \nSimplexvirus humanalpha1 (HSV-1) and Simplexvirus humanalpha2 (HSV-2), with \nspecific interference during the early stages of the viral replication cycle \nafter the adsorption period. TEO exhibited inhibitory effects at doses below the \ncytotoxic threshold, with IC50 values of 47 μg/mL for HSV-1 and 40 μg/mL for \nHSV-2. Maximum virus inhibition was achieved when TEO was added within 90 min \npost-infection, indicating interference with early viral replication steps. \nThese findings highlight the potential of TEO as a natural antiviral agent and \nsuggest further research into its mechanisms and clinical applications.\n\nDOI: 10.3390/life14081023\nPMCID: PMC11355936\nPMID: 39202765\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'}],

We studied 149 FVH patients (73 males and 76 females, aged 1-76) \nfor blood autoantibodies (auto-Abs) neutralizing type I interferons (IFNs; \nIFN-α2, -β, -ω). Six of 16 (37.5%) HSV-triggered FVH patients carried such \nauto-Abs on admission, including three with a previously known autoimmune \ndisease. These patients contrasted with 133 HAV- (n = 46) or HBV-triggered (n = \n87) patients, none of whom had such detectable auto-Abs. Odds ratios for \nHSV-triggered FVH in individuals with auto-Abs ranged from 35.3 (95% CI: \n13.0-96.2; P < 10-7) for those neutralizing only 100 pg/ml IFN-α/ω to 1,895 (CI: \n448.5-8,002; P < 10-12) for those neutralizing both IFN-α and IFN-ω at 10 ng/ml. \nOver one third of HSV-triggered FVH cases in this international cohort were due \nto preexisting auto-Abs. This finding highlights auto-Abs against type I IFNs as \na major determinant of HSV-FVH and paves the way for targeted preventive or \ntherapeutic interventions.\n\n© 2025 Gervais et al.\n\nDOI: 10.1084/jem.20251760\nPMCID: PMC12679989\nPMID: 41348319 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Disclosures: E.

Despite limited sequence homology to cellular kinases \nsuch as Akt or PKA, US3 phosphorylates diverse substrates to manipulate multiple \npathways. This review summarizes current knowledge of US3 functions across \nseveral major areas, including suppression of innate immune responses through \nmodulation of NF-κB, ERK/MAPK, TBK1/IRF3, RIG-I; promotion of cell survival via \nphosphorylation of canonical Akt substrates such as TSC2, FOXO1/3, and BAD; and \nfacilitation of nuclear egress through modification of lamin A/C, emerin, and \nthe nuclear egress complex proteins UL31 and UL34. By comparing US3's strategies \nwith those of cellular kinases and other viral effectors, this review highlights \nconvergent mechanisms of host manipulation.

Excessive activation of STING is associated with \nmany diseases, but the regulatory mechanism of STING activation remains to be \nfurther elucidated. Here, we identify VAPB as a negative regulator of \nSTING-mediated innate immune response. VAPB deficiency increases the expression \nof type I interferons under resting conditions or upon stimulation. \nMechanistically, VAPB associates and translocates with STING, thereby regulating \nSTING translocation, oligomerization, and recruitment of TBK1. In vivo, \ndeficiency of VAPB enhances the expression of type I interferons and prevents \nlethality following HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, VAPB P56S, a pathogenic \nmutation causing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), can promote STING-mediated \ninnate immune response under resting conditions, which might contribute to \nfurther understanding of the relationship between cGAS-STING pathway and ALS. \nOur study identifies VAPB as a critical regulating factor in cGAS-STING-mediated \ninnate immune responses.\n\nDOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aea3996\nPMCID: PMC12674132\nPMID: 41337593 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflict \nof interests.'},

Its \npresentation can mimic demyelinating disorders such myelin oligodendrocyte \nglycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD), and neuromyelitis optica \nspectrum disorder (NMOSD), posing a diagnostic challenge.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 31-year-old previously healthy male who \npresented with holocranial headache followed by bilateral limb and facial \nnumbness, right hemibody sensory loss, left temporal visual field deficit, and \nunsteadiness while walking. Neurological examination revealed dissociated \nsensory loss, gaze-evoked nystagmus, and impairment of cranial nerve functions, \nincluding visual field deficit and facial sensory loss, indicating involvement \nof the optic and trigeminal nerves, respectively. MRI showed hyperintensities in \nthe pontine tegmentum and middle cerebellar peduncles with enhancement of \nbilateral trigeminal nerves. CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis. MOG \nand AQP4 antibodies were negative. VEP showed left optic pathway involvement. \nInitial treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone showed no improvement. A \nviral etiology was considered, and CSF PCR was positive for HSV. The patient \nimproved significantly following a 21-day course of intravenous acyclovir.\nCONCLUSION: This case underscores the importance of considering HSV \nrhomboencephalitis in the differential diagnosis of brainstem syndromes, \nparticularly those mimicking demyelination. Early identification and antiviral \ntherapy are crucial to prevent long-term neurological sequelae.\n\n© 2025.

We \nneed to better understand the etiology of this disease and identify new risk \nfactors. We examined whether common genital infections are associated with \nendometrial cancer.\nMETHODS: Using serum samples from The Polish Endometrial Cancer Study (443 \ncases, 443 controls), we measured antibodies against microbial antigens with a \nmultiplex fluorescent bead-based assay. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (OR) \nand 95% confidence intervals (CI), comparing women with positive versus negative \nserology.\nRESULTS: Most antibodies were not associated with endometrial cancer overall, \nbut seropositivity for Herpes simplex virus 2 was associated with low-grade \ntumors (OR 1.43 CI 1.02, 2.00). While increased risks for type II, but not type \nI tumors, were consistently indicated for multiple Chlamydia trachomatis \nantigens, most estimates did not reach statistical significance (e.g., Pgp3 \nseropositivity and type I cancers: OR 0.97 CI 0.73, 1.31; and type II: OR 2.96 \nCI 0.85, 10.31; heterogeneity p-value\u2009=\u20090.03). The strongest associations for \ntype II tumors were observed with seropositivity for Chlamydial stress response \nproteins.\nCONCLUSION: Reproductive tract infections may increase risk for endometrial \ncancer, but the biologic mechanisms are likely both microbe- and \nhistology-specific. Some C. trachomatis infections may be a risk factor for type \nII endometrial cancers. Given that so few risk factors for type II endometrial \ncancers are identified, infection-related mechanisms of carcinogenesis in the \nendometrium merit continued investigation.\n\n© 2025.

This study designed and evaluated \nthe performance of an in-house multiplex real-time PCR for simultaneous \ndetection of these viruses. Materials and Methods: Plasma samples from 270 \ntransplant patients were tested using an in-house multiplex real-time PCR assay \nspecifically designed for HSV, VZV, and EBV. Analytical specificity and the \nassay's limit of detection (LOD) were determined. Statistical analyses were \nperformed to evaluate the agreement between the in-house assay and the reference \nkit. Results: The method had a specificity of 98% for HSV, 97% for VZV, and 95% \nfor EBV, alongside 100% sensitivity for all three viruses. No cross-reactivity \nwas observed with other viral or bacterial DNA. The LOD for the in-house assay \nwas determined to be 6.25, 25, and 25 copies/mL for HSV, VZV, and EBV, \nrespectively. Additionally, precision analysis showed low CV values in both \nintra-assay and interassay evaluations (HSV: 1.5%-1.8%; VZV: 2.3%-2.6%; and EBV: \n3.7%-3.9%), confirming the assay's robust analytical precision. Bland-Altman \nanalysis showed mean differences of 1.35, -3.29, and 1.75 for HSV, VZV, and EBV, \nrespectively. This multiplex real-time PCR method enables detection at lower \nconcentrations. Cross-reactivity testing confirmed no interaction with DNA from \nother viruses or nontarget microorganisms. Bland-Altman and linear regression \nanalyses also showed a strong agreement between commercial and in-house methods. \nConclusion: These findings, compared to Altona diagnostic kits, highlight the \nvalue of designing and applying advanced diagnostic assays in managing viral \ninfections in transplant patients.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Reyhaneh Kalhor et al.

While \nHSV-1-encoded microRNAs (v-miRs) are known to regulate viral latency and immune \nevasion, their role in acute mucosal infection remains unclear. This study \ninvestigates the function of v-miRs during acute HSV-1 infection of the cornea.\nMETHODS: Using a murine model of corneal HSV-1 infection, we performed RNA \nsequencing and in situ hybridization to identify v-miRs enriched in the cornea \nduring acute infection. Topical locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified inhibitors \ntargeting individual v-miRs (miR-H1-5p, miR-H3-3p, miR-H6-3p, and miR-H27) were \nadministered, and effects on disease severity, viral replication, immune \nresponse, and lymphoid cell activation were assessed.\nRESULTS: Inhibition of select v-miRs significantly attenuated corneal keratitis, \nreduced viral titers, and suppressed Th1/Th17-mediated inflammation. v-miR \ninhibition also decreased immune cell infiltration in draining lymph nodes and \nenhanced the frequency of IL-10-producing CD4⁺ T cells. Expression of \nimmunoregulatory genes, including Arg1 and CD25, was increased, and T-cell \nproliferation was reduced ex vivo, indicating the establishment of a \ntissue-protective immune environment.\nCONCLUSIONS: HSV-1 v-miRs act as key immunoregulatory effectors during acute \ncorneal infection. Their targeted inhibition using LNA-based therapy mitigates \ninflammation and promotes immune regulation, highlighting a novel therapeutic \nstrategy for ocular HSV-1 disease.\n\nDOI: 10.1167/iovs.66.12.16\nPMCID: PMC12422390\nPMID: 40910727 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Disclosure: C.D.

In kids, CpHV-1 \ninduces severe systemic disease with high morbidity and mortality, whereas in \nadult goats, the infection leads to genital lesions such as vulvovaginitis or \nbalanoposthitis, with abortions occurring mainly in the second half of \ngestation. CpHV-1 shares several biological characteristics with human \nherpesvirus 2, including molecular features, tropism for vaginal epithelium, \ngenital lesion nature, and latency in the sacral ganglia. These features make \nCpHV-1-infected goats a reliable animal model for studying human \nherpesvirus-induced genital disease, relevant for pathogenic research, as well \nas the development of new vaccines and antiviral agents.

While G4s have \nbeen identified as regulatory elements in both human and viral genomes, iMs \nremain largely unexplored. This study investigates the presence of iMs in the \nimmediate-early (IE) promoters of human Alphaherpesviruses (αHHVs), namely \nherpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 and varicella-zoster \nvirus. αHHVs IE promoters, crucial for initiating an efficient viral cycle, \nembed G4s, but the potential presence of iMs in these regions is unknown. We \nidentified highly conserved putative iM-forming sequences in IE promoters of all \nαHHVs. Biophysical characterization by circular dichroism, thermal difference \nspectroscopy and bromine footprinting, confirmed the ability of these sequences \nto form iMs in vitro, with varying conformations and distributions among the \nthree viruses. Using a CUT&Tag-qPCR assay, we detected and quantified both iM \nand G4 structures in the HSV-1 genome during active viral infection. Our results \nshow the dynamic formation of iMs and G4s in IE promoters, with enrichment \nlevels changing over time.

Establishing the level of antibodies considered \nprotective is essential for vaccine standardization and evaluation of efficacy. \nThe virus neutralization test (VNT), recognized as the gold standard for \ndetecting virus-specific antibodies able to neutralize virus.\nMETHODS: This study evaluated the effect of viral dose on the detection of \nhumoral immune responses in rabbits vaccinated with a cowpox virus-based \nvaccine. Blood serum samples were collected on days 14, 21, and 28 \npost-vaccination. VNT was conducted using viral doses of 100, 50, 25, and 10 \nTCID50. Additionally, the infectious dose 50 (ID50) of the challenge virus was \ndetermined based on the induction of skin necrosis in 50% of infected animals. \nThis dose (316 ID50 per 0.1 mL) was then used to challenge vaccinated rabbits in \norder to determine the protective antibody titer threshold.\nRESULTS: Lower viral doses (25 and 10 TCID50) demonstrated higher sensitivity, \nwith neutralizing antibody titers detected at 1:16 and above, significantly \nexceeding those obtained using 50 and 100 TCID50. Based on these findings, 25 \nTCID50 was selected as the optimal dose for future VNT. Following cowpox virus \nchallenge, rabbits with neutralizing titers ≥1:16 were protected from skin \nnecrosis, while non-immunized animals developed characteristic lesions.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that a low-dose (25 TCID50) VNT improves the \nsensitivity and that a titer of 1:16 can be considered a protective threshold. \nThis approach provides a reliable laboratory model for assessing the \nimmunogenicity and efficacy of cowpox virus vaccines. The results obtained in \nthis study allow for an objective assessment of the immunity elicited from a \ncowpox vaccine using a laboratory model.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Mambetaliyev, Alieva, Abduraimov, Rsaliyev and Zhugunissov.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1640056\nPMCID: PMC12320384\nPMID: 40761797 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Authors YA and AR were employed by National \nHolding “QazBioPharm”.

We hope to \nfacilitate the discovery of antiviral drugs for MPXV by providing insights into \nthe further development of appropriate anti-Mpox drugs based on currently \navailable viral protein targets.\n\n© 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/med.70004\nPMID: 40717583 [Indexed for MEDLINE]'}],

Data sorting to prioritize zoonotic agents in a geographic \narea need constant updating, but no regular official programs are ongoing, to \nallow an efficient risk survey for these animal species. This study aimed to \nconduct a comprehensive investigation of the prevalence of certain known, \npotential and emerging zoonoses within the framework of the routine monitoring \nof dog and cat shelters in North-East Italy.\nMETHODS: A total of 389 cats and 257 dogs housed in public veterinary services \nshelters and feline colonies were included in the present investigation. The \nanimals originated from the provinces of Padua, Venice, Rovigo, Vicenza, Verona, \nTrento and Bolzano. Serological, molecular and microbiological diagnostics were \nimplemented to investigate the prevalence of Leptospira sp., Brucella canis, \nLeishmania infantum, dermatophytes, gastrointestinal parasites, \nantimicrobial-resistant bacteria, Capnocytophaga sp., Bartonella sp., Norovirus, \nRotavirus A, Cowpox virus, Mammalian Orthoreovirus, Hepatitis E virus, \nSARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A virus.\nRESULTS: Data about some known zoonoses (e.g., serological positivity of \nLeishmania infantum 25% and Leptospira sp. 44.3% in dogs, and Bartonella \nhenselae 70% in cats) resulted aligned with previous research and recent \nreports, whereas there was a notable occurrence of some potential, emerging and \nneglected pathogens (e.g., Mammalian Orthoreovirus 0.38% in dogs and 2.83% in \ncats). For some other agents (e.g., dermatophytes in dogs and in cats) the \nprevalence resulted lower than expected.\nDISCUSSION: The prevention of the zoonotic risk requires a re-examination of the \ncomplex interaction between humans, animals, and environment. This is of \nparticular importance in settings like companion animal shelters, which serve as \nkey sites for disease monitoring and zoonotic risk mitigation. The study \nhighlights the need to monitor and prioritize the zoonotic pathogens, to \nimplement and constantly update surveillance and specific training programs for \nthe kennels' operators, and management of epidemiological risks.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Mazzotta, Lucchese, Corrò, Ceglie, Danesi, Capello and Natale.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fvets.2024.1490649\nPMCID: PMC11631924\nPMID: 39664895\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."},

The \nMpox outbreak with more than 90,000 cases worldwide since 2022 generated great \nconcern about future outbreaks\xa0and highlighted the need for a simple and rapid \ndiagnostic test.

Until \nnow, although there are no specific vaccines for MPOXV, there are no \ncomprehensive vaccines for all dangerous poxviruses. This research utilizes \nimmunoinformatics and structural vaccinology methodologies to develop a \nmulti-epitope mRNA vaccine targeting variola virus (VARV), vaccinia virus \n(VACV), monkeypox virus (MPOXV), and cowpox virus (CPXV), which are four \npathogenic orthopoxviruses (OPV). Accordingly, A29L, M1R, A35R, B6R, and F8L \nantigens were selected. Then, their sequences were retrieved and aligned to \ndetermine the conserved parts of each antigenic region among these four types of \nviruses. Different immunoinformatic methods were employed for forecasting \nB-cell, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and helper T lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes. \nThe epitopes were analyzed through a filtering process that checked for \nantigenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, and cytokine inducibility. The goal was \nto find epitopes that can make both T- and B-cells react. The vaccine was \nconstructed and modeled via the trRosetta server. Molecular docking was employed \nbetween the epitopes and adjuvant receptors along with MHC type I and II \nmolecules. Subsequently, the best structure with low energy was selected, and \nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. The immunological simulation \ndata indicated that the developed vaccine possesses significant potential to \nprovoke both cellular and humoral immune responses. Finally, with in vitro and \nin vivo experiments in the future, the designed vaccine could be a promising \ncandidate for vaccination against pathogenic poxviruses.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the uptake and yield of \npoint-of-care screening for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and \nTrichomonas vaginalis, integrated with HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B virus (HBV) \nscreening in antenatal care (ANC) in Zimbabwe, and conducted a mixed-methods \nprocess evaluation of the strategy.\nMETHODS: A prospective interventional study was conducted in two public-sector \nANC clinics in Harare. Clients attending for ANC were screened in parallel for \nC. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, HBV, HIV and syphilis, using four \ndifferent point-of-care tests. Uptake of STI testing and treatment was recorded. \nInterviews and focus group discussions with pregnant women, healthcare \nprofessionals and the intervention team were conducted and analysed \nthematically. Implementation, mechanisms of impact and context were explored \nusing the Medical Research Council Process Evaluation Framework.\nRESULTS: Between 12 January 2023 and 23 October 2023, there were 13\u2009500 ANC \nattendances over 207 implementation days. Of 1105 (8.2%) assessed for \neligibility, 1103 (99.8%) were eligible, of whom uptake of the full screening \npackage was 91.0% (1004/1103). Curable STI prevalence was 30.7% (308/1003), of \nwhom 303 (98.4%) received same-day treatment. HBV prevalence was 1.4% (14/1003). \nThe prevalence of HIV was 10.5% (105/1003), with 20 (19.0%) being new \ndiagnoses.Although the intervention was highly acceptable, diagnostic capacity \nand workload were barriers to recruitment. In particular, the collection and \ntesting of multiple sample types with different tests, with a range of reading \ntimes, was challenging.\nCONCLUSION: We demonstrated high levels of acceptability, screening uptake and \nsame-day treatment. However, a low proportion of ANC attendees were enrolled \noverall, and current technological limitations preclude this particular testing \nstrategy from being scaled up beyond low-volume settings. We recommend \ninvestment into the development of STI point-of-care tests with shorter analytic \ntimes and research into alternative strategies involving laboratory-based \nhigh-throughput testing.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05541081; registered 15 \nSeptember 2022.\n\n© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

Rapid and simple detection methods are vital for early intervention \nto reduce severity and mortality. In this study, we designed highly specific RPA \nprimers and crRNA (CRISPR RNA) based on the highly conserved CPSIT_0429 gene in \nthe C. psittaci genome, and preliminarily established a nucleic acid detection \nmethod for C. psittaci using the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a system. In the two-step \nassay, the combination of the CPSIT_0429-F1/R1 primer pair and CPSIT_0429-crRNA2 \nachieved a detection limit of 2\xa0×\xa010° copies/μL. Incorporating 20% glycerol \nenabled a one-tube assay with a limit of 2\xa0×\xa0102 copies/μL. Furthermore, the \nmethod showed no cross-reactivity with common respiratory pathogens such as \nInfluenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, demonstrating \nexcellent specificity. Both the two-step and one-tube methods were compared with \nqPCR-verified C. psittaci positive samples. The results indicated that both \nassays showed high consistency with qPCR results. The RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a \ndetection method is rapid, accurate, highly sensitive, and specific, providing a \nreliable platform for early diagnosis and clinical management of C. psittaci \ninfections.\n\n© The Author(s) 2025.

Emergency department (ED) visits \noffer a unique opportunity to increase STI testing. However, providers in the ED \nmay not have the time or self-efficacy to screen patients, and patients may be \nunable to initiate discussion on their STI care needs. A patient decision aid \nmay improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the ED encounter for STI \ntesting.\nOBJECTIVE: This study aims to pilot STI Check in the Emergency Room (STIckER) \napp, a shared decision-making aid for urinary, oral, and rectal gonorrhea and \nchlamydia testing among adolescents and young adults, and assess STIckER's \nefficacy and implementation outcomes in an adult and pediatric ED.\nMETHODS: We are conducting a parallel-group, two-arm provider-randomized \ncontrolled pilot trial in the adult and pediatric EDs at an urban academic \nmedical center. Fifty providers were randomized 1:1 to intervention (trained on \nSTIckER) or control (standard of care). Adolescents and young adults aged 14-24 \nyears, English-speaking, and sexually active within the past 6 months are \nrecruited during eligible shifts and assigned to the study arm of their \nprovider. The standard of care comparator consists of usual provider-initiated \nSTI discussions and testing without access to the decision aid; control \nparticipants receive a QR code directing them to a simple landing page \nencouraging them to ask their provider about STI testing. The planned enrollment \ntarget was 44 providers and 140 adolescent and young adult participants. Primary \noutcome is preliminary efficacy, defined as the proportion of adolescents and \nyoung adults receiving gonorrhea and chlamydia testing based on electronic \nmedical record (EMR) review. Secondary outcomes include extragenital testing \nuptake, STI positivity rates, decisional conflict, and perceived level of shared \ndecision-making. Implementation outcomes include feasibility, acceptability, \nappropriateness (using acceptability of intervention measure, intervention \nappropriateness measure, and feasibility of intervention measure), and provider \nself-efficacy. Data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression \nmodels, with mixed-effects models applied if clustering by provider is detected. \nExploratory analyses will examine differences by patient age, gender, and sexual \nidentity, and provider characteristics.\nRESULTS: Between September 2023 and July 2025, we completed recruitment of 44 \nproviders and 139 adolescent and young adult participants across both adult and \npediatric EDs. Enrollment targets were met, with high fidelity to intervention \ndelivery and strong rates of survey completion by both patients and providers. \nFinal data cleaning and analyses are underway, and primary results are expected \nto be available in late 2025.\nCONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial will provide critical data on the feasibility, \nacceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a digital SDM tool to increase STI \ntesting in the ED. Findings will inform the design of a future multisite trial \nand the potential for scaling STIckER to support equitable, patient-centered STI \nscreening across diverse clinical settings.\n\n© Jason Zucker, Delivette Castor, Marc A Probst, Talia Adler, Lisa-Pierre \nTchoungui, Jaciara De Souza, Christina Franqui, Lauren Chernick.

Despite this burden, \nestablishing cost-effective early warning systems through surface water-based \nsurveillance (SWBS) remains underexplored, particularly in low-resource \nsettings. Here, we address this gap by analyzing fecal shedding patterns of two \ntypical zoonotic pathogens: Chlamydia psittaci and influenza A virus (IAV) in \nboth patients and birds. Using these data, we developed a novel theoretical \nframework to evaluate the feasibility of SWBS for C. psittaci and IAV in surface \nwater. Our findings first reveal high positivity rates of C. psittaci (8-16 %) \nand IAV (16-84 %) were detected in cloacal swab samples, with significant \nvariations observed among different bird species. Specifically, the highest \ndetection rates for IAV were found in chickens (84.0 %, 84/100), ducks (70.0 %, \n70/100), and geese (66.0 %, 33/50), while C. psittaci showed the highest \npositivity in pigeons (16 %, 8/50) and chickens (16 %, 16/100). Meanwhile, we \nalso unravel high shedding rates in human feces (IAV: 44.7 %, 4.25 × 106 \ncopies/g; C. psittaci: 37.6 %, 2.25 × 104 copies/g). IAV was predicted to become \nquantifiable in surface water once ≥29 (18-41; 50 % CI) infected birds were \npresent nearby. Monte Carlo simulations further indicated that IAV would reach \nthe limit of detection in the sewershed when ≥17 (7-28; 50 % CI) human \ninfections had occurred. In contrast, C. psittaci was only reliably detectable \nduring the peak of infection in wild-bird habitats and unlikely to be detected \nin the sewage from the community. We validated these predictions through \nprospective environmental surveillance across three sewersheds near a migratory \nbird habitat (January-July 2024), confirming the model's accuracy. Our work \nestablishes a robust, data-driven approach to optimize environmental \nsurveillance design in resource-limited contexts, offering a scalable strategy \nfor pandemic preparedness and early warning of infectious disease threats.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

Ethiopia continues to report a high prevalence \ndespite ongoing control efforts. The Health Extension Program (HEP) aims to \nimprove household hygiene and sanitation. This is the first study to quantify \nthe direct association between household-level HEP adherence and active trachoma \nprevalence.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of active trachoma among children aged 1-9 \nyears and examine its association with household-level HEP adherence in Northern \nEthiopia.\nMETHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 \nchildren in Wag Hemra Zone, Northern Ethiopia from March-May 2025. A simple \nrandom sampling identified households, and one child per household was included. \nData on socio-demographics, HEP adherence, and WASH practices were collected \nusing structured questionnaires. Clinical examination for active trachoma \n(TF/TI) was performed by trained ophthalmic nurses following the WHO simplified \ngrading system. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses identified \nfactors associated with active trachoma (p < 0.05).\nRESULTS: The overall prevalence of active trachoma was 6.3% (95% CI: 4.0-9.2%). \nOnly 40% of households demonstrated high HEP adherence (≥75% of recommended \npractices). In multivariable analysis, children from low-adherence households \nwere more likely to have active trachoma (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.5-6.7). Poor \nfacial hygiene (AOR = 2.8; 95% CI: 1.3-5.9) and lack of functional latrines (AOR \n= 2.5; 95% CI: 1.1-5.6) were also significant predictors. Age, sex, and parental \neducation were not independently associated.\nCONCLUSION: Despite improvements in HEP coverage, active trachoma remains above \nthe WHO elimination threshold in Northern Ethiopia. Household-level adherence to \nhygiene and sanitation practices, facial cleanliness, and latrine use are key \ndeterminants of disease risk. Strengthening HEP implementation, promoting facial \nhygiene, and improving sanitation infrastructure are critical for accelerating \nprogress toward trachoma elimination. These findings underscore the need for \nenhanced community-level interventions and targeted HEP strategies to accelerate \ntrachoma elimination in Ethiopia and similar endemic settings.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

The knowledge of their potential harm to wildlife, livestock, and \npets is fragmentary. These ectoparasites have been historically understudied, as \nthey were only considered nuisances to various occupational groups and the \npublic. However, there is also mounting evidence that they may be pathogen \nvectors as several infectious disease agents, including Acinetobacter, \nAnaplasma, Bartonella, Borrelia, Coxiella, Francisella, Mycoplasma, Rickettsia, \nChlamydia-like organisms, Trypanosoma, Babesia, and viruses such as Sigmavirus \nlipoptenae and Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus, have been detected in deer keds. \nIn this context, deer keds should be considered a highly probable vector for \nBartonella schoenbuchensis. Persons at risk include anyone who travels or \nresides in the habitats of deer keds, primarily forests and their immediate \nsurroundings in the Northern Hemisphere, whether for leisure or work purposes, \nparticularly in temperate regions of Europe, Siberia, China, and North America. \nThey also occur in Central and South America, the Russian Federation, South \nKorea, Thailand, Japan, Algeria, and Southern Spain. The ongoing rise in \ntemperatures due to climate change is likely to favor the spread of deer keds, \nas it alters host distributions and increases their activity levels. Measures to \nprevent bites include avoiding areas with a high occurrence of deer keds, \nwearing protective clothing, including permethrin-treated clothing, and \nconducting a thorough body check for deer keds and bite sites after spending \ntime or working in a risk area. Medical professionals should consider deer ked \nbites in their differential diagnoses. To ensure occupational and public health \nsafety, it is crucial to educate and train at-risk workers (such as woodsman, \nforesters, employees of national parks, naturalists, farmers, and veterinarians) \nand those recreating in forests (such as walkers, hikers, hunters, or mushroom \npickers) about deer ked bites, their symptoms, and possible zoonotic \nimplications. This review summarizes the recent knowledge regarding the health \nrisks posed by deer keds, applicable to both occupational groups and anyone who \nmay encounter them within their geographic distribution.\n\n© 2025.

C. pecorum, PhaHV, trypanosomes, and KoRV \n(endogenous subtype A and exogenous subtype D) were detected in 61.1%, 68.9%, \n63.3% and 100% of the individuals sampled, respectively.

Among koalas with chlamydiosis, PhaHV-1 mucosal \nshedding positively predicted euthanasia on admission, and accounting for \nTrypanosome irwini infection status improved the model quality. Additionally, in \nfemale koalas, the detection of mucosal PhaHV-1 and greater KoRV proviral pol \nloads were equal predictors of chlamydial reproductive disease.

This bacterium has 19 identified genotypes. This study \naimed to evaluate the prevalence and genotype characterization of genital \nChlamydia among women of reproductive age in both trachoma-endemic and \nnonendemic regions of Tanzania.\nMETHODS: From May 2022 to May 2023, we conducted a cross-sectional study \ninvolving 400 women attending antenatal and child health clinics in district \nhospitals located in trachoma-endemic and nonendemic areas. Endocervical swabs \nwere collected, and DNA was extracted for analysis. Polymerase chain reaction \n(PCR) was used to amplify the ompA gene, and the resulting PCR products were \nsequenced and compared with reference sequences from GenBank using BLAST to \nidentify genotypes.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of genital Chlamydia was 2.3% (9 cases). The genotypes \ndetected were L1 and F, each accounting for 11.1% of the cases. The infection \nrate was particularly high among women aged 25\u2009years or younger.\nCONCLUSION: The study found a significant prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis \namong young women (≤\u200925\u2009years) and identified genotypes F and L1. These results \nhighlight the need for ongoing surveillance and targeted public health \nstrategies to manage and prevent Chlamydia infections, particularly among young \nwomen in both trachoma-endemic and nonendemic regions of Tanzania.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Rehesina H.

Psittacosis, caused by Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci), is a \nzoonotic disease transmitted from birds to humans. It can present with a wide \nspectrum of symptoms, ranging from mild flu-like illness to life-threatening \nsevere pneumonia. Cases of C. psittaci infection complicated by organizing \npneumonia (OP) are rarely reported, and delayed treatment may pose a \nlife-threatening risk.\nMETHODS: We report a case of C. psittaci pneumonia complicated by OP. To \nidentify additional cases and clarify the clinical features of this condition, a \nliterature search was conducted using the PubMed and Embase databases for the \nperiod from January 1995 to May 2025. The search included the following \nkeywords: "psittacosis," "Chlamydia psittaci," "chlamydia," "organizing \npneumonia," and "bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia."\nRESULTS: A 66-year-old male with a history of poultry farming presented with \nfever, cough, sputum production, and hemoptysis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy \nwith ceftizoxime was ineffective. To identify the etiology of the pulmonary \nlesions, bronchoscopy was performed, and C. psittaci infection was confirmed by \nmetagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid \n(BALF). Although the lesions partially resolved after moxifloxacin therapy, the \npatient experienced recurrent episodes. Chest CT revealed migratory lesions, \nwhich are uncommon in C. psittaci pneumonia. Further pathological examination of \nthe specimen confirmed the diagnosis of OP. The patient\'s condition improved \nfollowing corticosteroid therapy. A review of the literature indicated that none \nof the three previously reported cases were definitively diagnosed at initial \nadmission; all presented primarily with fever and cough. One case progressed to \nsevere pneumonia and resulted in death.\nCONCLUSION: OP caused by C. psittaci pneumonia presents with non-specific \nsymptoms and signs, making early diagnosis challenging. During treatment of C. \npsittaci pneumonia, if empirical anti-infective therapy shows no response after \nthree days, or if imaging reveals features such as consolidation, migratory \nlesions, or a reverse halo sign, the possibility of concurrent OP should be \nconsidered. Pathological examination is recommended in such cases to avoid \nmissed diagnosis and to ensure timely intervention.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Li, Sun, Lei, Zhu, Du, Jiang and Su.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmed.2025.1670456\nPMCID: PMC12665588\nPMID: 41333773\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.'},

This study aims to delineate the differences between C. psittaci \npneumonia and L. pneumonia.\nMETHODS: This retrospective analysis included 71 cases of C. psittaci pneumonia \nand 21 cases of L. pneumonia, all confirmed via next-generation sequencing \n(NGS). We systematically collected and compared data on clinical \ncharacteristics, laboratory findings, chest CT imaging, bronchoscopic \nobservations, and prognostic outcomes between the two groups.\nRESULTS: In the C. psittaci pneumonia cohort, 64 patients (91.4%) had an \nopportunity to contact with poultry, with a maximum temperature of mean 39.6\u202f°C. \nAdditionally, 23 patients (32.4%) experienced dyspnea, and 57 patients (80.3%) \nexhibited relative bradycardia. Compared to patients with L. pneumonia, those \nwith C. psittaci pneumonia had lower leukocyte counts, neutrophil counts, \nmononuclear cell counts, systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI), and urea \nlevels, while lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase \n(ALT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), and creatine kinase (CK) levels \nwere elevated. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) plays a crucial role in the \nearly diagnosis of infectious pathogens. Multivariate analysis revealed \ndifferences in underlying diseases, residing in countryside, relative \nbradycardia, and LMR between the two groups.\nCONCLUSION: Several characteristics aid in differentiating C. psittaci pneumonia \nfrom L. pneumonia, including exposure to poultry, relative bradycardia, some \ninfection indicators, ALT, AST, and CK. NGS addresses the limitations of \ntraditional diagnostic methods. The early application of NGS facilitates the \ndiagnosis of atypical pneumonia. Multivariate regression analysis suggested that \nunderlying diseases, residing in countryside, relative bradycardia, and LMR is \nsignificant in differentiating C. psittaci pneumonia and L. pneumonia.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Chen, Yang, Liu, Zhou, Li, Wang and Zheng.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fmed.2025.1653394\nPMCID: PMC12646901\nPMID: 41312459\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."},

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is an advanced, \ncomprehensive, unbiased diagnostic tool for pathogen identification in \ninfectious diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of mNGS \nfor diagnosing severe pneumonia.\nMETHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 323 patients with suspected severe \npneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan University Renmin \nHospital between January 2022 and December 2023. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid \n(BALF) samples were collected from all 323 patients, and blood samples were \nobtained from 80 patients. Both mNGS and conventional microbial testing (CMT) \nwere performed on the collected BALF and blood samples to analyze the pathogen \nspectrum. The diagnostic performance of mNGS and CMT was systematically \nevaluated and compared.\nRESULTS: The overall positivity rate of mNGS was significantly greater than that \nof CMT (93.5% vs. 55.7%, p < 0.001). mNGS demonstrated significantly greater \nsensitivity than did CMT (94.74% vs. 57.24%, p < 0.001) but lower specificity \n(26.32% vs. 68.42%, p < 0.01). mNGS identified 36 bacterial species, 14 fungal \nspecies, 7 viral species, and 1 Chlamydia species, whereas CMT detected 21 \nbacterial species and 9 fungal species. According to the pathogen spectrum, \nKlebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida albicans were the \npredominant pathogens associated with severe pneumonia. The detection rate of \nmixed infections was significantly higher with mNGS than with CMT (62.8% vs. \n18.3%, p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with CMT methods, mNGS has significant advantages in \npathogen detection for severe pneumonia. Owing to its broad detection range and \nhigh sensitivity, mNGS serves as a valuable complementary approach to \ntraditional culture-based methods.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Huang, Zhang, Dong, Chen, Zou, Liu, Guo, Gao, Ke and Wu.\n\nDOI: 10.3389/fcimb.2025.1661213\nPMCID: PMC12631761\nPMID: 41278474 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that the research was \nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest."},

Microbes directly participate in key soil processes \nand play crucial roles in maintaining soil functions. However, we still have a \nlimited understanding of underlying mechanisms shaping microbial communities and \nthe interactions among microbial taxa in park soils.\nMETHODS: In this study, the community variations of bacteria and fungi in urban \nand suburban park soils were investigated in Shanghai, China. Real-time PCR and \nhigh-throughput Illumina sequencing were used to examine the microbial abundance \nand community composition, respectively.\nRESULTS: The results showed that soil molecular biomass and fungal abundance in \nurban park soils were significantly higher than those in suburban park soils, \nwhile no significant difference was observed in the bacterial abundance between \nurban and suburban park soils. The alpha diversity of soil microbes in urban and \nsuburban park soils was similar to each other, except for Chao1 index of fungal \ncommunities. The results of similarity analysis (ANOSIM) revealed remarkable \ndifferences in the composition of bacterial and fungal communities between urban \nand suburban park soils. Specifically, park soils in urban areas were enriched \nwith the phyla Methylomirabilota and Verrucomicrobiota, while the relative \nabundance of Gemmatimonadota was higher in suburban park soils. Moreover, the \nfungal class Eurotiomycetes was also enriched in urban park soils. Compared with \nsuburban park soils, nodes and average paths of the bacterial and fungal \nnetworks were higher in urban park soils, but the number of module hubs and \nconnectors of the bacterial networks and negative interactions among bacterial \ntaxa were lower. Compared with suburban park soils, Acidobacteriota bacterium \nand Mortierellomycota fungus played more important roles in the ecological \nnetworks of urban park soils.
